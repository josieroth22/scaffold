# The Scaffold Strategy

## A College Planning Blueprint for Nora Kaplan

*Prepared for Sarah & Ethan Kaplan | Bethesda, MD | February 2026*
*Class of 2029 | Walt Whitman High School (MCPS)*

---

## Executive Summary

**Nora at a glance:** Current freshman, 3.9 unweighted GPA, all honors with an AP Human Geography 5. Strongest assets are her academic consistency, her verbal and written skills, and a latent design/architecture interest that she hasn't recognized as a strength yet. Main vulnerability is a lack of differentiation: her profile is currently interchangeable with thousands of other suburban overachievers at schools exactly like Whitman. Projected SAT range: 1480-1540. Two-parent household, $235K combined income, significant home equity ($540K) that complicates CSS Profile calculations.

**The School List:**

| School | Tier | Est. Net Cost/Year | Financial Risk |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Harvard | Reach | $18,000-25,000 | Moderate |
| Penn | Reach | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| Columbia | Reach | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| Brown | Reach | $18,000-25,000 | Moderate |
| Cornell AAP | Reach | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| Georgetown | Reach | $40,000-52,000 | High |
| Johns Hopkins | Target-Reach | $22,000-35,000 | Moderate-High |
| WashU (Sam Fox) | Target-Reach | $20,000-30,000 | Moderate |
| Tufts | Target | $22,000-32,000 | Moderate |
| UVA (Out-of-State) | Target | $28,000-38,000 | Moderate |
| Northeastern | Target | $25,000-40,000 | Moderate-High |
| UMD Honors | Safety | $12,000-15,000 | Very Low |

**Top 3 things to do in the next 6 months:**

1. **Get Nora into a real design or architecture experience this summer.** Not coding camp, not Model UN practice. A hands-on studio program where she draws, builds models, and discovers whether Ms. Novak was right. Look at the National Building Museum's summer programs, Catholic University's pre-college architecture studio, or even a week-long intensive at the Corcoran. This is the single most important move for her entire application trajectory.
2. **Drop coding club.** She told you she's not into it. Believe her. Replace it with something connected to the design thread. Whitman's art department, an independent architecture project, a portfolio-building class. Every hour she spends performing interest in coding is an hour she's not developing the thing that might actually set her apart.
3. **Have a conversation with her about what she actually wants.** Not "where do you want to go to college?" That question paralyzes her. Try: "What's the last thing you made that you were proud of?" or "Why did you stare at the Hirshhorn for 45 minutes?" She needs permission to take her own interests seriously, and right now her peer group is telling her that pre-med and finance are the only serious paths.

**The financial floor:** University of Maryland, College Park with Honors College and in-state tuition. Admission probability: ~90%. Estimated net cost: $12,000-15,000/year. This is not the consolation prize. This is a top-20 public university, 25 minutes from your house, with a strong architecture program and an Honors experience that rivals many private colleges. If every reach and target falls through, UMD is a genuinely excellent outcome, and I will spend some time below convincing you of that.

**The headline number:** Across projected scenarios, the median best annual cost is approximately **$20,000/year**, or **$80,000 total** for four years. There is roughly a **75% chance** that Nora will have at least one option under $30,000/year. The range is wide because your income puts you in the financial aid "donut hole," and the CSS Profile home equity treatment varies dramatically by school.

## Before We Start

Sarah and Ethan, you said something in your intake that I want to address before anything else: "What makes Nora different from the other 10,000 girls at competitive suburban public schools doing the exact same things?"

Nothing. Right now, nothing.

That's not a failure. It's a diagnosis. And the fact that you can see it clearly at 14 instead of discovering it at 17, in the middle of application season, when it's too late, gives you three years to fix it.

Here's what this document is and what it isn't.

**It is:** A specific, data-informed plan for Nora's next three and a half years, built around your finances, your geography, your schools, and the kid you've described to me. It includes a school list with honest financial analysis, a developmental roadmap, an application strategy, and a financial simulation. Every recommendation is specific to Nora, not generic advice you could find in a college prep book.

**It isn't:** A guarantee. Plans change. Kids change. Nora might discover that she hates architecture and wants to study neuroscience. She might pull her GPA up to a 4.0 or she might hit a wall in AP Chemistry. The plan below works at multiple levels of outcome because I've built it with a floor, not just a ceiling.

A few things I want to be honest about before we get into it:

1. **Nora's profile is strong but undifferentiated.** A 3.9 GPA with all honors at Whitman, AP Human Geo with a 5, JV soccer, Model UN, food bank volunteering. You know what every admissions officer at a selective school calls this? Tuesday. Whitman sends dozens of kids with this profile to competitive schools every year, and the ones who get into the Ivies have something that sets them apart. Nora doesn't have that yet. She can.

2. **The design/architecture thread is real, and she's dismissing it.** Ms. Novak told you Nora has "a real eye for spatial design." Nora spent 45 minutes at the Hirshhorn staring at the building, not the art. She sketches floor plans for fun. She rearranged her room three times this year. She watches design and architecture content constantly. Sarah, Ethan, this is not a hobby. This is an unrecognized passion that she's suppressing because her peer group has taught her that "serious" means pre-med or business. The entire strategy below is built around helping Nora discover and own this thread. If she does, she's no longer one of 10,000. She's the girl who thinks about how spaces shape human experience, and she can show you what she means.

3. **Your financial situation is more complicated than you realize.** At $235K combined income, you're in what financial aid professionals call the "donut hole." You earn too much to qualify for significant need-based grants at most schools, but not enough to comfortably write a check for $85,000/year. The CSS Profile's treatment of your home equity ($540K, which is your home value minus your mortgage) will hurt you at schools that count it. Some schools count it fully, some cap it, some ignore it. The difference can be $10,000-15,000/year in expected family contribution. I'll walk through this school by school.

4. **QuestBridge is not an option for your family.** QuestBridge serves families earning under $65,000-75,000/year with limited assets. At $235K with $540K in home equity, you're well above the threshold. I mention this only because families sometimes ask about it. It's not your path. Your path runs through need-based institutional aid at schools that meet full need, merit scholarships where available, and strategic school selection to minimize the gap between what schools think you can pay and what you can actually pay.

5. **The sibling math matters more than you think.** Eli is 11. He hits the college pipeline in about seven years. If Nora goes to a school that costs $40,000/year, you'll have spent $160,000 by the time Eli is a junior in high school. If she goes to UMD at $14,000/year, you'll have spent $56,000 and have the financial flexibility to help Eli. The $104,000 difference between those two paths is not abstract. It's Eli's options.

6. **Nora is showing burnout symptoms at 14, and that scares me more than her college list.** She makes to-do lists for her to-do lists. She cried over an A-. She told you she feels like she's "losing the race" with a 3.9 GPA. She's performing instead of exploring. The plan below isn't just about getting into a selective school. It's about helping Nora find something she genuinely cares about, because a kid who discovers a real passion at 15 is a better student, a better applicant, and a healthier human being than a kid who optimizes everything for college and arrives on campus burned out.

Let's get into it.

---

## The Four Threads

Every strong college application tells a coherent story. Not a fabricated one, a real one. Looking at Nora's profile, four threads emerge, but only if we develop the one she's been ignoring.

**Thread 1: The Spatial Thinker.** This is the anchor, and it's the thread that transforms Nora's application from "another strong Whitman student" to someone genuinely interesting. Nora notices how spaces work. She rearranges rooms, sketches floor plans, stares at buildings. She processes the world visually and spatially in a way that most students don't. This thread runs through architecture, design, urban planning, and the way physical environments shape human behavior. It connects her AP Human Geography interest (how does place shape society?) to something personal and tangible. When admissions officers read about the girl who spent 45 minutes studying the Hirshhorn's architecture while her classmates walked past, they'll remember her.

**Thread 2: The Analytical Writer.** Nora is a strong writer by every measure. She gets A's on essays consistently. She reads constantly. She has verbal and written skills that will serve her across every application. This thread supports the application broadly and makes her essays sharp. It's the connector, not the spike.

**Thread 3: Academic Rigor in a Competitive Environment.** Whitman is one of the most competitive public high schools in the country. MCPS is one of the strongest districts. A 3.9 UW GPA with the most rigorous course load available is a real achievement, and colleges know it. This thread is table stakes at the schools she's targeting, not a differentiator, but its absence would disqualify her.

**Thread 4: Community and Perspective.** The food bank volunteering, Model UN (if she stays and takes a leadership role), and any future community engagement around design, public space, or housing. This thread shows that Nora's interests aren't just academic. She cares about how the built environment affects people's lives, not just aesthetically but socially. A project that connects her design thinking to community impact would make this thread sing.

The key insight: Threads 2, 3, and 4 are what every strong Whitman applicant has. Thread 1 is what makes Nora different. The entire strategy is built around developing Thread 1 from "something she does casually" to "the defining feature of her application."

---

## The School List

Twelve schools. Four reaches, two reach-targets, three targets, and one safety with a secret weapon. Every school on this list was chosen because it connects to Nora's emerging profile, has a realistic admission path, and has a financial model I can explain honestly.

Sarah, Ethan, I need to say something before we go school by school. You ranked prestige #3 and then said, "it matters to us more than we want to admit." I appreciate the honesty. Here's mine: the Ivy League is not a financial plan. It's a brand. At your income level, the Ivies will cost you $18,000-28,000/year after need-based aid, which is real money but manageable. Georgetown, which you drive past every day and probably think of as a peer, will cost you $40,000-52,000/year because it has a weaker endowment and meets need less generously. Meanwhile, UMD with Honors and in-state tuition will cost you $12,000-15,000/year, and its architecture program is nationally ranked.

The name on the sweatshirt is not always correlated with the cost. The cheapest schools on this list might surprise you.

---

#### REACHES

These are schools where admission is highly uncertain (under 10% overall admit rate for most, under 15% for others) but where the academic and financial fit justifies applying. At your income, the Ivies and schools that meet full demonstrated need are actually more affordable than many schools with lower sticker prices.

---

**1. Harvard University**
*Cambridge, MA | ~3.5% admit rate | ~7,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** You're thinking about it. Nora's thinking about it. Everyone at Whitman is thinking about it. So let's be honest about what it means for your family specifically. Harvard meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, and they don't include home equity in their calculation. Read that again. Harvard uses its own financial aid formula, and it excludes home equity for families earning under $240,000. At $235K, you likely qualify. That means your $540K in home equity doesn't count against you here, which is a massive advantage over schools that do count it.

**Academic fit:** Harvard doesn't have an undergraduate architecture major, but it does have the Graduate School of Design (GSD), and undergrads can take courses there. The Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) program and the joint concentration in History of Art and Architecture would let Nora explore design thinking within a liberal arts framework. If she decides architecture isn't her path, Harvard is Harvard. She can pivot.

**Cultural fit:** Large Jewish community. Active Hillel. Cambridge is a great college town for a curious, bookish kid. The campus is more diverse socioeconomically than its reputation suggests, thanks to the generous aid. But it's also intensely competitive and can exacerbate the exact achievement-anxiety pattern Nora already shows.

**The honest truth:** At 3.5% admission, this is a lottery ticket for everyone, including valedictorians. Nora's emerging design interest could actually help here, because it differentiates her from the sea of "strong suburban GPA + Model UN + soccer" applicants that Harvard sees from Bethesda every year. But nobody should plan around Harvard. Apply, don't obsess.

**Financial analysis at your income ($235K, home equity excluded):**
Harvard's financial aid formula for families earning $150K-250K typically produces an expected contribution of 10-15% of income. At $235K, expect to pay roughly $23,000-35,000/year before any scholarship adjustments. However, Harvard's aid is famously generous and the home equity exclusion is a major factor for your family.

**Estimated net cost:** $18,000-25,000/year | **4-year total:** $72,000-100,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** The home equity exclusion helps enormously. This is actually one of the better financial outcomes if she's admitted.

---

**2. University of Pennsylvania**
*Philadelphia, PA | ~5.4% admit rate | ~10,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Penn has the Weitzman School of Design (formerly PennDesign), and undergraduates in the College of Arts & Sciences can access courses in architecture, urban studies, and design through Penn's interdisciplinary structure. The combination of a liberal arts education with access to a professional design school is almost unique. Penn also meets 100% of demonstrated financial need with no loans in the aid package.

**Academic fit:** The Urban Studies major in the College, combined with access to Weitzman courses, gives Nora a path to explore architecture and design without committing to a five-year professional degree as a freshman. The combination of humanities strength, quantitative skills, and design thinking is exactly what Penn values. The Integrated Studies program allows cross-school enrollment.

**Cultural fit:** Philadelphia is a real city. Penn's campus is urban and diverse. The Jewish community is among the strongest in the Ivy League (Penn was historically a school with deep Jewish roots). The campus culture is pre-professional and ambitious, which could feed or drain Nora's competitive instincts, depending on how she manages them.

**The honest truth:** Penn's aid is generous, but they DO include home equity in the CSS Profile calculation. At $540K in home equity, Penn's institutional methodology will increase your expected family contribution by roughly $5,000-10,000/year compared to Harvard's formula. That's the difference between $20,000/year and $28,000/year.

**Estimated net cost:** $18,000-28,000/year | **4-year total:** $72,000-112,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Home equity inclusion hurts. Aid is still substantial but expect a higher family contribution than at Harvard.

---

**3. Columbia University**
*New York, NY | ~3.9% admit rate | ~8,500 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Columbia is in New York. For a kid interested in architecture and design, there is no better city. The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) is world-class, and undergrads can engage with it. The architecture and urban studies offerings in the College are strong. The Core Curriculum, which every Columbia student takes, feeds Nora's broad intellectual curiosity while her design interests develop.

**Academic fit:** Columbia's Art History and Visual Arts programs are excellent. The Urban Studies concentration connects architecture to social justice and city planning. New York itself becomes the classroom: Nora would be studying design in a city that is a living textbook of architecture, from Grand Central to the High Line to the brutalist housing projects.

**Cultural fit:** New York is not Bethesda. It's loud, expensive, fast, and stimulating. For some students, this is transformative. For an anxious overachiever, it can be overwhelming. The Jewish community is enormous, both on campus and in the city. Columbia's campus in Morningside Heights is a pocket of calm relative to the city, but the pace is real.

**The honest truth:** Columbia counts home equity, and their institutional methodology is among the more aggressive in the Ivy League. At your income with $540K in home equity, the family contribution could be steep. Also, Columbia's campus housing is notoriously limited, and the cost of living in New York adds up in ways that don't show up on the financial aid letter.

**Estimated net cost:** $18,000-28,000/year | **4-year total:** $72,000-112,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Same home equity concern as Penn. New York cost of living is an additional wildcard.

---

**4. Brown University**
*Providence, RI | ~5% admit rate | ~7,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Brown's open curriculum means Nora doesn't have to declare a major or follow distribution requirements. For a kid who doesn't know what she wants to study yet, that's freeing rather than paralyzing. She can explore architecture, visual arts, urban studies, and anything else without being locked in. Brown also has a strong Visual Arts department and a partnership with the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), one of the best design schools in the world. Brown/RISD dual degree is a five-year program that combines a Brown liberal arts degree with a RISD BFA.

**Academic fit:** The Brown/RISD Dual Degree program is the dream scenario for a kid like Nora. It's insanely competitive (roughly 20 spots per year), but even without the dual degree, Brown students can cross-register at RISD for courses. Nora could take a RISD architecture studio while being a Brown student. That's a rare combination.

**Cultural fit:** Brown is the least pre-professional Ivy. The open curriculum means students are exploring because they want to, not because they're chasing a grade. For Nora, who has spent her entire academic life doing what looks good rather than what feels right, Brown's culture could be the permission she needs to take her own interests seriously. Solid Jewish community. Providence is small and manageable.

**The honest truth:** Brown meets full demonstrated need, but like Penn and Columbia, they use the CSS Profile with home equity. The cross-registration with RISD is a selling point, but the dual degree is extremely selective on top of already being extremely selective. Don't build the plan around it; treat it as upside.

**Estimated net cost:** $18,000-25,000/year | **4-year total:** $72,000-100,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Home equity is a factor but Brown's formula is slightly less aggressive than Columbia's.

---

**5. Cornell University, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP)**
*Ithaca, NY | ~7.9% overall, AAP is ~10-12% | ~15,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** This is the school that the design thread was built for. Cornell AAP offers a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) that is one of the most respected professional architecture programs in the country. It's Ivy League. It's rigorous. And for a student with Nora's emerging design sensibility, it's a direct pathway to a career in architecture that doesn't require graduate school.

**Academic fit:** The B.Arch at Cornell AAP is a fully accredited professional degree. Students begin studio work in the first semester. They design, they build models, they critique each other's work. It's hands-on in a way that most Ivy League programs are not. If Nora applies to AAP and presents a portfolio that shows spatial thinking and design curiosity, she tells a story that no other applicant from Whitman is telling.

The risk: a B.Arch is a five-year commitment. Nora would need to be reasonably confident that architecture is her direction. If she's not sure, Cornell's College of Arts & Sciences has Urban and Regional Studies as a major, which gives her architecture-adjacent coursework without the professional degree commitment.

**Cultural fit:** Ithaca is rural and isolated. It is not Bethesda or DC. The winters are brutal. Cornell is large enough that she'd find her people, but the geography is a real adjustment. Active Jewish community (Cornell Hillel is strong). The AAP cohort is small and tight-knit, roughly 40-50 students per class.

**The honest truth:** Cornell AAP admits students directly into the program, and they require or strongly encourage a portfolio for B.Arch applicants. If Nora develops a design portfolio over the next three years, she has a compelling story that most applicants don't. Cornell's admit rate for AAP is slightly higher than Cornell's overall rate, and the applicant pool is self-selecting (students who genuinely want to study architecture). This is where the design thread goes from "interesting differentiator" to "the reason she got in."

Cornell counts home equity on the CSS Profile. Their financial aid is generous but not quite as generous as Harvard's.

**Estimated net cost:** $18,000-28,000/year | **4-year total:** $90,000-140,000 (five-year program)

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** The fifth year adds cost. But a B.Arch leads directly to professional practice without needing a master's degree, which saves $100K+ in graduate school costs.

---

**6. Georgetown University**
*Washington, DC | ~12% admit rate | ~7,500 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** You drive past it. Nora knows the campus. Ethan went to Georgetown Law. The family connection is real, and Georgetown does consider legacy in admissions (though how much is debated). Georgetown has no architecture program, but it has strong programs in government, international affairs, and the humanities.

**Academic fit:** Georgetown is not the best fit for the design thread. It's on this list because of the family connection, the proximity, and the academic reputation. If Nora ends up pursuing political science, public policy, or international relations (which are the fields her friends are talking about), Georgetown is excellent. But if the design thread takes hold, Georgetown becomes less strategically important.

**Cultural fit:** DC is home. Nora would be 20 minutes from her house. That's a pro (comfort, family, familiarity) and a con (not a fresh start, still in the Bethesda orbit). Georgetown's campus is beautiful. The student body is preppy, Catholic-influenced, politically engaged, and ambitious. Jewish community is present but smaller than at the Ivies.

**The honest truth, and this is the part you won't like:** Georgetown does not meet 100% of demonstrated need for all admitted students. They try, but gaps happen. Georgetown's endowment ($4.5 billion) is smaller than Harvard's ($50 billion), Penn's ($20 billion), or any of the Ivies. At your income with home equity, Georgetown could leave a gap of $10,000-15,000/year that you'd need to cover. That puts the real cost at $40,000-52,000/year.

Ethan, Sarah, I need to say this directly: Georgetown might be the most expensive school on this list. More expensive than Harvard. More expensive than any of the Ivies. The family connection has emotional value. It doesn't have financial value. Apply if you want. Just know what you're getting into.

**Estimated net cost:** $40,000-52,000/year | **4-year total:** $160,000-208,000

**Financial risk: HIGH.** Weaker endowment, doesn't consistently meet full need, home equity fully counted. This is the school most likely to produce sticker shock.

---

#### TARGET-REACHES

These are schools where admission is more likely than the Ivies but still competitive, and where the academic fit for Nora's emerging profile is strong.

---

**7. Johns Hopkins University**
*Baltimore, MD | ~6.5% admit rate | ~6,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Sarah, your colleague at NIH keeps telling you to look at Hopkins. Your colleague is right, but maybe not for the reasons they think. Hopkins has traditionally been known for pre-med and biomedical engineering, but its humanities and social sciences are underrated, and more importantly for Nora, the Homewood campus is 40 minutes from your house, which means you get semi-local proximity with genuine prestige.

**Academic fit:** Hopkins doesn't have an architecture program, but it has strong programs in History of Art, International Studies, and Writing Seminars. The interdisciplinary flexibility is real. Nora could combine design-adjacent coursework with her broader humanities interests. The proximity to Baltimore's architectural landscape (everything from the Inner Harbor to vacant rowhomes to the MICA campus) provides real-world design context.

**Cultural fit:** Baltimore is not Bethesda. The campus is in the Homewood neighborhood, which is pleasant, but Baltimore's challenges are visible and real. For some students, that's motivating. Hopkins has a strong Jewish community and an active Hillel. The student body skews pre-professional and intense, which could either comfort or exhaust Nora.

**The honest truth:** Hopkins meets 100% of demonstrated need, but they use the CSS Profile with home equity. Their financial aid is strong but not as generous dollar-for-dollar as Harvard's. The admit rate has dropped dramatically in recent years (from 11% to under 7%), making it a reach in all but name. I'm classifying it as target-reach because Nora's Whitman pedigree and strong humanities profile are a fit, and Maryland residency can be a subtle positive.

**Estimated net cost:** $22,000-35,000/year | **4-year total:** $88,000-140,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE-HIGH.** Home equity inclusion. Strong aid but the gap could be $5,000-10,000 more than the Ivies.

---

**8. Washington University in St. Louis (Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts)**
*St. Louis, MO | ~11% admit rate | ~8,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** WashU's Sam Fox School houses one of the best undergraduate architecture programs in the country. It offers both a B.A. in Architecture and a five-year B.Arch, giving Nora flexibility. WashU meets 100% of demonstrated financial need and has been increasingly generous with aid packages in recent years. And almost nobody from Whitman applies here, which means Nora isn't competing against her classmates.

**Academic fit:** This is the hidden gem on the list for the design thread. Sam Fox's architecture program emphasizes design thinking, sustainability, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Students work in real studios from the beginning. The College of Arts & Sciences is strong, so if Nora wants a liberal arts experience with architecture as a concentration rather than a professional degree, she can do that too. The B.A. in Architecture is a four-year degree that provides design education without the five-year commitment of a B.Arch.

**Cultural fit:** St. Louis is the Midwest, which you said you'd "consider for the right school." The campus is gorgeous (seriously, Google it) and self-contained. The student body is smart, collaborative, and less cutthroat than the East Coast equivalents. Jewish community is strong (historically, WashU has had significant Jewish enrollment). Nora would be far from home, which could be exactly what she needs to figure out who she is outside of the Bethesda pressure cooker.

**The honest truth:** WashU meets full need and they cap home equity at a reasonable level in their CSS Profile calculations, which is better for your family than many peer schools. The architecture program is less well-known than Cornell AAP but the education is excellent and the admit rate is more favorable. WashU is also known for generous merit scholarships, though these are highly competitive.

**Estimated net cost:** $20,000-30,000/year | **4-year total:** $80,000-120,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Home equity capped. Full need met. This could be one of the better financial outcomes among the selective schools.

#### TARGETS

These are schools where admission is more likely than the reaches, and where the academic and financial fit is favorable.

---

**9. Tufts University**
*Medford/Somerville, MA | ~10% admit rate | ~6,500 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Nora's friend's sister goes there and loves it. That's actually worth something, because it means Nora has a personal connection and a realistic mental picture. Tufts is one of the most underrated schools in the country: excellent academics, genuine intellectual culture, and a location just outside Boston that gives access to a world-class city without being swallowed by it.

**Academic fit:** Tufts has the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA), which Tufts students can access for studio art and design courses. The combination of a liberal arts curriculum with SMFA access mirrors (on a smaller scale) the Brown/RISD dynamic. Tufts also has strong programs in international relations, environmental studies, and the humanities. For a student who isn't sure yet whether architecture is her path, Tufts gives her room to explore.

**Cultural fit:** Tufts is the "anti-Ivy Ivy." Students tend to be smart, engaged, and a little offbeat. The campus is more collaborative than competitive. Active Jewish community. The Medford/Somerville location is quieter than downtown Boston but accessible via the T. For Nora, who seems to perform under pressure but doesn't thrive under it, Tufts' culture might be healthier than a more intense environment.

**The honest truth:** Tufts meets full demonstrated need but uses the CSS Profile with home equity. Their admit rate has been dropping steadily and is now in the same range as several Ivies, which makes the "target" classification generous. Nora's Whitman profile is competitive here. The design thread, combined with strong academics, makes her interesting rather than generic.

**Estimated net cost:** $22,000-32,000/year | **4-year total:** $88,000-128,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Full need met but home equity counted. Expect a family contribution of $25K-35K.

**10. University of Virginia**
*Charlottesville, VA | ~16% overall, ~18% out-of-state | ~17,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Lots of Whitman kids go to UVA, and there's a reason. It's a top-25 national university with a beautiful campus, strong academics, and a culture that appeals to the Bethesda demographic. The School of Architecture is well-regarded and offers undergraduate programs in architecture and urban/environmental planning.

**Academic fit:** UVA's School of Architecture offers a B.S. in Architecture (four-year pre-professional degree) and a B.A. in Urban and Environmental Planning. Both are strong programs that connect to Nora's emerging interests. The School of Architecture is separate from the College of Arts & Sciences, so she'd apply directly if she's confident in the design direction, or she could enter the College and explore architecture courses before committing.

**Cultural fit:** Charlottesville is a college town with charm and history (and complicated history). UVA's culture is social, preppy, and Southern in a way that's different from Bethesda but not foreign. Active Jewish community. Greek life is significant. Nora would know people there from Whitman, which is a comfort but also means she might not break out of her existing social patterns.

**The honest truth:** UVA is a public university, and as an out-of-state student, Nora does not get in-state tuition. Out-of-state cost of attendance is roughly $72,000/year before aid. UVA's financial aid for out-of-state students has been improving (the Cavalier Commitment program reduces loans for Virginia residents, and AccessUVA pledges to meet full need for all students). At your income, the net cost will be significantly higher than in-state schools but potentially competitive with private schools that meet full need. Home equity treatment varies.

**Estimated net cost:** $28,000-38,000/year | **4-year total:** $112,000-152,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Out-of-state premium hurts. Aid is improving but not at the level of the elite privates.

---

**11. Northeastern University**
*Boston, MA | ~5% admit rate | ~16,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** The co-op program. Northeastern's signature is that students alternate semesters of coursework with semesters of paid professional work experience. For a student interested in architecture or design, this means working at architecture firms, design studios, or urban planning offices during college, building a portfolio of real work, and graduating with a resume that most 22-year-olds can't match. Northeastern also has a strong Architecture program.

**Academic fit:** Northeastern's School of Architecture offers a B.Arch (five years) and a B.S. in Architecture (four years with co-op). The co-op integration means Nora would be designing in school and working in firms within two years. The program is accredited and well-connected to Boston's robust architecture and design industry. The co-op placements include firms in New York, DC, and internationally.

**Cultural fit:** Boston is a great city for a student from Bethesda. Urban, walkable, intellectual. Northeastern's campus is in the Fenway area. The student body is career-oriented and practical. Jewish community is fine but less central than at some schools on this list.

**The honest truth:** Northeastern has become dramatically more selective in recent years and now has an admit rate comparable to the Ivies. Its financial aid, however, is not at Ivy levels. Northeastern does not consistently meet 100% of demonstrated need. They offer significant merit-based scholarships, but at your income level, the gap between sticker price and aid could be meaningful. The co-op program generates income for students ($15K-25K per year during co-op semesters), which helps offset costs. But the five-year B.Arch timeline means five years of tuition.

**Estimated net cost:** $25,000-40,000/year | **4-year total (or 5-year B.Arch):** $100,000-200,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE-HIGH.** Does not meet full need. Merit dependent. Co-op income helps but doesn't close the whole gap.

#### SAFETY

One safety school. One. Because you only need one if it's good enough that you'd be genuinely happy there.

---

**12. University of Maryland, College Park (Honors College)**
*College Park, MD | ~45% admit rate (Honors is more selective, ~20-25%) | ~31,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Sarah, Ethan, I know. Nora said "that's where you go if you don't get in anywhere." You said you "kind of feel the same way." I'm going to spend more time on UMD than on any other school on this list, because the gap between what you believe about Maryland and what's actually true is costing you money and limiting your thinking.

**The reality check:**

UMD's School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation is one of the top architecture programs in the country. Design Intelligence consistently ranks it in the top 10-15 nationally. The program is accredited, well-funded, and located 25 minutes from one of the most architecturally significant cities in America. Students regularly win national design competitions, get internships at DC-area firms (which are among the best in the world), and go on to top graduate programs.

The Honors College provides a small-college experience within a major research university: priority registration, smaller classes (many capped at 20), dedicated advisors, and a living-learning community. Honors students at UMD routinely get into top graduate and professional programs. They are not students who "didn't get in anywhere." They are students who did the math.

**The financial math:**

| Scenario | Tuition | Room/Board | Fees | Scholarships | **Net Cost** |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| In-state, no merit | $10,800 | $13,700 | $1,800 | $0 | **~$26,300/yr** |
| In-state, Honors + merit ($5K) | $10,800 | $13,700 | $1,800 | -$5,000 | **~$21,300/yr** |
| In-state, Banneker/Key Scholarship | $10,800 | $13,700 | $1,800 | -$12,000+ | **~$14,300/yr or less** |
| In-state, full Banneker/Key | $10,800 | $13,700 | $1,800 | Full tuition + stipend | **~$12,000/yr** |

The Banneker/Key Scholarship is UMD's premier merit award. It ranges from partial tuition to a full ride (tuition, fees, room, board, and a book stipend). Nora's profile, 3.9 GPA, AP scores, Whitman pedigree, would make her a strong candidate for a partial or full Banneker/Key.

Now compare that to Georgetown at $45,000/year. Or Johns Hopkins at $28,000/year. Over four years:

| School | 4-Year Total (Est.) | Difference vs. UMD |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| UMD (Honors, some merit) | $56,000-85,000 | -- |
| Harvard (if admitted) | $72,000-100,000 | +$15,000-$44,000 |
| Georgetown | $160,000-208,000 | +$75,000-$152,000 |
| UVA (OOS) | $112,000-152,000 | +$27,000-$96,000 |

**Academic fit:** The architecture program is the headline. But UMD also has strong programs in government and politics, English, computer science, and engineering. The Gemstone Honors program (research-focused) and Honors Humanities (interdisciplinary) are excellent. The proximity to DC means internship access that most schools can't match: the Smithsonian, the National Gallery, the AIA headquarters, every major architecture firm and design consultancy in the capital region.

**Cultural fit:** This is where Nora's resistance lives. UMD is big (31,000 undergrads), and it's close to home. It doesn't have the prestige cachet that her Whitman friends are competing for. She might feel like she "lost the race." That's a real concern, and it's an emotional one that the numbers above don't address.

Here's what I'd say to Nora directly if I could: the students who thrive at UMD Honors aren't the ones who "settled." They're the ones who chose strategically and then went deep. A student in UMD's architecture program who interns at a top DC firm every summer, wins a national design competition, and graduates debt-free is in a stronger position at 22 than a student who went to Georgetown and owes $150,000.

**The Eli factor:** If Nora goes to UMD at $14,000/year, you save roughly $60,000-$100,000 compared to any Ivy. That money is Eli's freedom. It's the difference between telling Eli in seven years "we can help" and "we already spent it on your sister."

**Estimated net cost:** $12,000-15,000/year (with merit aid) | **4-year total:** $48,000-60,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.** In-state tuition, strong merit aid probability, no home equity complications. This is the financial floor, and it's a good one.

## School List Summary

| # | School | Tier | Admit Rate | Meets Full Need | Home Equity Treatment | Est. Net Cost/Year | Financial Risk |
|---|--------|------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Harvard | Reach | ~3.5% | Yes | Excluded (<$240K) | $18,000-25,000 | Moderate |
| 2 | Penn | Reach | ~5.4% | Yes | Included (full) | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| 3 | Columbia | Reach | ~3.9% | Yes | Included (aggressive) | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| 4 | Brown | Reach | ~5% | Yes | Included | $18,000-25,000 | Moderate |
| 5 | Cornell AAP | Reach | ~10-12% | Yes | Included | $18,000-28,000 | Moderate |
| 6 | Georgetown | Reach | ~12% | Not fully | Included (full) | $40,000-52,000 | High |
| 7 | Johns Hopkins | Target-Reach | ~6.5% | Yes | Included | $22,000-35,000 | Moderate-High |
| 8 | WashU (Sam Fox) | Target-Reach | ~11% | Yes | Capped | $20,000-30,000 | Moderate |
| 9 | Tufts | Target | ~10% | Yes | Included | $22,000-32,000 | Moderate |
| 10 | UVA | Target | ~18% OOS | Yes (AccessUVA) | Varies | $28,000-38,000 | Moderate |
| 11 | Northeastern | Target | ~5% | No | Included | $25,000-40,000 | Moderate-High |
| 12 | UMD Honors | Safety | ~45% (20-25% Honors) | N/A (in-state + merit) | N/A | $12,000-15,000 | Very Low |

**The pattern you should see:** The Ivies that meet full need and exclude (or cap) home equity are actually more affordable than Georgetown and Northeastern, which have lower endowments and less generous aid. UMD is the clear financial winner. The design-focused schools (Cornell AAP, WashU Sam Fox, UMD Architecture) are where the spike strategy has the most impact on admission chances.

**Sarah, Ethan, one more thing about this list.** The home equity treatment is the single biggest variable in your financial picture. Your $540K in home equity could add $5,000-15,000/year to your expected family contribution at schools that count it aggressively. Harvard's exclusion of home equity for families under $240K makes it, paradoxically, one of the most affordable schools on this list. That should reshape how you think about "reach" versus "realistic."

## Financial Aid Strategy

This section is as important as the school list. Your family's financial picture has specific features that require specific strategies.

**FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)**

- **Who requires it:** Every school on the list.
- **When to file:** October 1 of senior year (October 1, 2028). File within the first two weeks. Earlier filing means earlier processing.
- **Which tax year:** For the 2029-2030 academic year, the FAFSA uses 2027 tax returns (prior-prior year).
- **Who files:** Both Sarah and Ethan, since you're married and in the same household.
- **Household size:** 4 (Sarah, Ethan, Nora, Eli).
- **Number in college:** 1 (Nora). Note: Under the FAFSA Simplification Act, having multiple children no longer reduces the SAI as dramatically as it once did. When Eli starts college in 2032-2033, having two in college simultaneously would help, but Nora will have graduated by then unless she's in a five-year program.
- **Expected SAI (Student Aid Index):** At $235K income, household of 4, with retirement assets and home equity (FAFSA does NOT count home equity or retirement accounts), your SAI will be approximately $45,000-55,000. This means Nora will NOT qualify for Pell Grants and your federal aid will be limited to unsubsidized loans ($5,500-7,000/year) and possibly work-study.
- **Important:** FAFSA does not count your home equity or your retirement accounts. This is an advantage for your family. The $380K in retirement and the $540K in home equity are invisible on the FAFSA.

**CSS Profile (College Scholarship Service Profile)**

- **Who requires it:** Harvard, Penn, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, WashU, Tufts, Northeastern. (UVA and UMD are FAFSA-only.)
- **When to file:** Typically October 1 for Early Action/Decision schools, January 1-15 for Regular Decision. Check each school's specific deadline.
- **Key difference from FAFSA:** The CSS Profile is where things get complicated for your family. It asks about home equity, business assets, retirement contributions, and non-retirement savings. Here is where the $540K in home equity becomes a factor.

**The Home Equity Problem (Read This Carefully):**

Your home is worth approximately $950K, and you owe $410K on the mortgage. That leaves $540K in home equity. On the FAFSA, this doesn't exist. On the CSS Profile, most schools ask about it, and many count a portion of it as an available asset when calculating what you can afford.

How different schools on your list treat home equity:

| School | Home Equity Treatment | Impact on Your Family |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Harvard | Excluded for families under $240K | No impact (your income is under $240K) |
| Brown | Capped at a percentage of income | Moderate impact (capped, not full) |
| Penn | Included (institutional formula) | Significant impact (could add $8K-12K/yr to EFC) |
| Columbia | Included (aggressive formula) | Significant impact |
| Cornell | Included (institutional formula) | Significant impact |
| Georgetown | Included fully | Major impact |
| Johns Hopkins | Included (institutional formula) | Significant impact |
| WashU | Capped at 1.2x income | Moderate impact (cap helps) |
| Tufts | Included (institutional formula) | Significant impact |
| Northeastern | Included (institutional formula) | Significant impact |
| UVA | FAFSA only | No impact |
| UMD | FAFSA only | No impact |

Ethan, Sarah, this table is worth studying. The schools that don't count (or cap) home equity, Harvard, WashU, UVA, UMD, are the ones where your net cost will be most favorable relative to other families at your income level. The schools that count it aggressively could expect you to contribute $8,000-15,000 more per year than FAFSA-only schools.

**Strategy: File the CSS Profile at every school that requires it, but when you get the aid offers back in March/April, compare them with full awareness that the variation is driven by home equity treatment.** If a school comes back with a package that seems worse than expected, call the financial aid office and ask whether their formula is counting your home equity at full value or a capped amount. Some schools will adjust if you make the case.

**Maryland-Specific: The 529 Plans**

You have $62,000 in Nora's 529 and $35,000 in Eli's. On FAFSA, 529 plans owned by a parent are counted as parental assets (at a rate of about 5.64% per year). So your $62K 529 adds roughly $3,500/year to your expected contribution. That's a modest impact. On the CSS Profile, the treatment is similar.

Do NOT use Eli's 529 for Nora. It's in Eli's name for a reason. Protect it.

**The 529 deployment strategy:** Use the $62K 529 to cover $15,500/year for four years, which offsets a significant chunk of the out-of-pocket cost at any school on the list. If Nora goes to UMD at $14,000/year, the 529 covers almost the entire cost. If she goes to an Ivy at $23,000/year, the 529 covers two-thirds of it.

## Simulation Results Summary

*(Based on projected parameters at the optimistic profile level)*

#### Admission Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one admission) | **99.9%** |
| P(at least one REACH admission) | **32%** |
| P(at least one TARGET or better) | **78%** |
| Median number of acceptances | **3** |
| Mean number of acceptances | **3.4** |

Sarah, Ethan, the bottom line: Nora will get into college. Multiple colleges. The question isn't whether. It's where, and at what price. The reach probability of 32% means there's roughly a one-in-three chance she gets into at least one Ivy or equivalent. Those odds are decent but far from certain. The plan is built so that the target and safety schools are genuinely excellent options, not consolation prizes.

#### Financial Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one school under $30K/year) | **75%** |
| Median best annual cost | **$20,000/year** |
| 10th percentile (best case) | **$13,000/year** |
| 25th percentile | **$15,000/year** |
| 75th percentile | **$30,000/year** |
| 90th percentile (worst realistic case) | **$40,000/year** |

The median outcome is $20,000/year, or $80,000 total for four years. That's inside your stated budget of $35,000-40,000/year with significant room to save for Eli. The worst realistic outcome ($40,000/year) is at the top of your stated budget, and even then, the 529 brings the out-of-pocket down to $24,500/year.

#### Chart 4: Sibling Budget Impact (Eli)

This chart models what your financial picture looks like when Eli starts college in 2032-2033, based on what Nora's education costs.

```
Scenario                        4-Yr Cost (Nora)   Remaining for Eli's 529 by 2032
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
UMD Honors ($14K/yr)            $56,000            $35K Eli 529 + $120K+ savings
Ivy w/ good aid ($22K/yr)       $88,000            $35K Eli 529 + $80K savings
Ivy w/ home equity hit ($30K)   $120,000           $35K Eli 529 + $40K savings
Georgetown ($45K/yr)            $180,000           $35K Eli 529 + $0 savings
Georgetown w/ loans             $200,000+          Eli is on his own
```

Ethan, Sarah, this chart is the reason I keep coming back to UMD. The difference between Nora at $14K/year and Nora at $45K/year isn't just $124,000. It's whether Eli has options. If you spend $180K on Nora, you'll be approaching 60 when Eli starts college, with a depleted savings account and $35K in his 529 that covers one year of state school tuition. That's a tight spot.

The math doesn't mean Nora can't go to an Ivy. It means the decision needs to account for Eli, not just Nora.

---

## Decision Framework: April 2029

When acceptances and aid packages arrive in March and April, here are the five most likely scenarios.

---

### Scenario A: Admitted to Harvard with Home Equity Exclusion

**Probability:** ~5-8%

**What it looks like:** Nora gets into Harvard. The financial aid package comes back at $20,000-25,000/year because Harvard's formula excludes your home equity. The 529 covers $15,500/year, so your true out-of-pocket is $5,000-10,000/year.

**4-year total cost:** $72,000-100,000 (before 529), or $10,000-38,000 (after 529)

**Recommendation:** Take it. At this price, Harvard is arguably a better financial deal than most targets on the list because of the home equity exclusion. The $62K 529 does heavy lifting here. And the academic and career outcomes from Harvard justify the remaining cost.

---

### Scenario B: Admitted to an Ivy/Elite That Counts Home Equity

**Probability:** ~20-25% (Penn, Columbia, Brown, or Cornell)

**What it looks like:** Nora gets into Penn or Cornell AAP. The aid package comes back at $25,000-30,000/year because they're counting your home equity. After the 529 ($15,500/year), your out-of-pocket is $10,000-15,000/year.

**4-year total cost (or 5-year for Cornell B.Arch):** $72,000-140,000 (before 529)

**Recommendation:** Compare the specific offers carefully. If she got into Cornell AAP with strong aid, the architecture-specific benefit may justify a higher price than a general liberal arts Ivy. If she got into Brown and wants the RISD cross-registration, that's worth paying for. If she got into Penn and the aid is $28K/year, compare it to WashU Sam Fox at $25K/year. The prestige difference is small; the financial difference is real.

**Negotiation lever:** If Harvard offered $20K/year and Penn offered $28K/year, share the Harvard offer with Penn and ask them to reconsider. Schools that meet full need have professional judgment authority to adjust. It doesn't always work, but a competing offer from a peer institution is the strongest card you can play.

---

### Scenario C: Admitted to WashU or Tufts with Strong Aid

**Probability:** ~25-30%

**What it looks like:** Nora gets into WashU Sam Fox and/or Tufts with an aid package of $22,000-28,000/year. These are excellent schools with strong design-adjacent programs, and WashU's home equity cap makes the aid more predictable.

**4-year total cost:** $88,000-112,000 (before 529)

**Recommendation:** WashU Sam Fox at $22K/year is one of the best outcomes on this list for the design track. If Nora is serious about architecture, WashU's program is nationally ranked and the financial model works. Tufts is the better option if she's less certain about architecture and wants maximum flexibility. Both are schools you should feel great about.

---

### Scenario D: UMD Honors with Banneker/Key Scholarship

**Probability:** ~50-60% (UMD admission), ~25-30% (Banneker/Key at some level)

**What it looks like:** Nora is admitted to UMD Honors and receives a Banneker/Key scholarship covering partial or full tuition. Net cost: $12,000-15,000/year. After the 529 ($15,500/year), the cost might be nearly zero.

**4-year total cost:** $48,000-60,000 (before 529), potentially $0-5,000 (after 529)

**Recommendation:** If the reaches and targets either don't admit her or come in at $35K+/year, UMD Honors with Banneker/Key is the smart play. Let me say that again: UMD Honors with a merit scholarship, in the architecture program, with DC internship access, at near-zero cost after the 529, is an outstanding outcome. Nora graduates at 22 with no debt, a strong portfolio, work experience at DC architecture firms, and $35K in Eli's 529 untouched.

This is not the consolation prize. This is the strategic play that every financial advisor would recommend and that most Bethesda families are too proud to accept.

---

### Scenario E: The Gap Year Option

**Probability of being the right call:** ~3-5%

**What it looks like:** Every offer is either a rejection or comes in at $40K+/year. The aid packages have gaps. The loans required are more than you're willing to take.

**Recommendation:** A gap year is an option, though it's unlikely to be necessary given the strength of the UMD floor. During a gap year, Nora could work at an architecture firm in DC (even as a file clerk or office assistant, the exposure matters), build her portfolio, and reapply with a stronger design narrative. Some schools allow deferred enrollment. But honestly, if UMD is on the table at $14K/year, a gap year probably doesn't make sense unless Nora's heart is truly set on a specific school that didn't work out.

## What to Do Now

Sarah, Ethan, here's what matters in the next six months. Everything else can wait.

1. **Get Nora into a design/architecture experience this summer.** This is the highest-leverage move in the entire plan. She needs to spend a week or more in a studio environment where she's drawing, making models, and thinking spatially. If she loves it, the entire strategy comes alive. If she doesn't, we pivot early and build a different spike. Either outcome is valuable. Options: National Building Museum summer programs, Catholic University Architecture pre-college, Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) summer intensives, or even a local architect willing to let her shadow for a week. Sarah, make the calls now. These programs fill early.

2. **Drop the activities that are resume filler.** Coding club goes. If she's not passionate about Model UN by the end of this year, that goes too. Soccer can stay if she loves it (and she seems to), but it's a social activity, not a college strategy. The goal is to free up time and mental energy for the things that actually matter.

3. **Talk to Ms. Novak.** Nora's 8th grade art teacher saw something. Reach back out to her and ask: what specifically did she see? Can she recommend programs, mentors, or next steps? Teachers who notice things like "a real eye for spatial design" are usually right, and they're usually willing to help if someone asks.

4. **Start the conversation about what Nora actually wants.** Not where she wants to go to college. What she wants to spend her time doing. What makes her lose track of time. What she'd build if nobody was grading her. The college process will go better if it's built on genuine interest rather than strategic performance.

5. **Read the Developmental Roadmap in the Reference Sections below.** It has the grade-by-grade course tables, extracurricular plans, and summer strategies. You don't need to memorize it. Just know it's there when you need it.

## 1. Developmental Roadmap

### Where Nora Is Right Now (Spring 2026)

**Strengths:**
- 3.9 unweighted GPA at Walt Whitman, one of the most competitive public high schools in Maryland and the country
- All honors courses as a freshman, demonstrating that she's on the most rigorous track available
- AP Human Geography with a 5, proving she can handle AP rigor and perform at the top
- 95th percentile MAP score in 8th grade, suggesting SAT potential in the 1450-1550 range
- Identified for MCPS Gifted and Talented in 3rd grade
- Strong writer across all subjects
- Reads voraciously (even if it's YA fiction, the habit is there)
- A latent design/architecture interest supported by observable behavior (Hirshhorn, floor plans, room rearranging, TikTok/YouTube content)

**Gaps to address:**
- No differentiation. Activities are generic. The profile reads "good student from good school" with nothing that makes her memorable.
- No design/architecture on the transcript or activities list yet. The interest is private. It needs to become visible.
- Burnout risk. She's performing, not exploring. She cries over an A-. She does activities because "I need activities." This trajectory leads to a senior year meltdown if unchecked.
- She doesn't know what she wants to study. "Maybe political science? Or business?" is code for "I have no idea and I'm saying what sounds respectable." That's normal at 14 but it needs to evolve.
- No test scores yet (PSAT is sophomore year). Her MAP scores project well, but the SAT is a different beast.

**Things that aren't gaps but might feel like them:**
- JV soccer without recruitment potential. That's fine. Unless she's getting recruited (she's not), soccer is a social and physical activity, not a strategic one. Keep playing if she enjoys it.
- Not being "the best" at anything yet. She's 14. The spike is something you build, not something you're born with.

---

### Summer Before 10th Grade (Summer 2026)

This is the pivotal summer. The design/architecture thread either starts here or it doesn't.

**The Design Exploration (Priority #1):**

Sign Nora up for a hands-on design or architecture program. The goal is not to commit her to architecture as a career. The goal is to give her a structured experience where she can test whether Ms. Novak was right. Options, in order of fit:

- **National Building Museum, Summer Design Studios (DC):** Free or low-cost programs for high school students exploring architecture, engineering, and design. Walking distance from Metro. This is the most accessible option.
- **Catholic University of America, Pre-College Architecture Program (DC):** A week-long intensive for high school students interested in architecture. Studio-based, with model-building and design projects. Typically $500-800.
- **MICA Pre-College (Baltimore):** Maryland Institute College of Art has summer programs for high schoolers in design, architecture, and visual arts. More art-focused than architecture, but the studio experience is excellent. 2-4 week programs, $1,500-3,000.
- **Cooper Hewitt Design Museum programs (NYC):** If you're willing to send her to New York for a week, the Cooper Hewitt (Smithsonian Design Museum) runs teen design programs. Free or low-cost.
- **Shadow a local architect.** DC has hundreds of architecture firms. Ethan, use your network. Find someone willing to let Nora shadow for a week. She'll see what the profession actually looks like: the drawings, the models, the client meetings, the site visits. Real-world exposure beats any camp.

**Academics:**
- Light review of upcoming coursework (AP World History reading, if she's taking it)
- Start thinking about a personal project. Can she redesign a public space in Bethesda? Sketch a proposal for improving the school courtyard? The portfolio starts now, even informally.

**Extracurriculars:**
- If Model UN has a summer conference or prep session, she can attend if she wants. But do not prioritize it over the design exploration.
- Continue soccer if there's a summer league or camp. Physical activity is good for mental health, especially for an anxious overachiever.

**What Not to Do:**
- Do not sign her up for coding camp because "tech looks good on applications." She told you she doesn't like coding. Believe her.
- Do not fill every week with structured activities. She needs downtime to doodle, sketch, watch architecture videos, and be a 15-year-old.
- Do not tell her "this is for your college applications." Frame the design program as "you seem interested in this, let's explore it." The moment it becomes a strategic exercise, she'll perform instead of explore.

---

### 10th Grade (2026-2027)

Sophomore year is where the profile takes shape. The design thread starts appearing on the transcript and activities list. The academic rigor increases. The PSAT provides a baseline for test prep planning.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| English 10 | Honors | Continue top track. Build the relationship with this teacher (potential rec letter). |
| AP World History | AP | Natural fit for her interests. Second AP, and the global perspective connects to design/architecture thinking about how cultures build differently. |
| Honors Algebra 2 / Trigonometry | Honors | She's in Honors Geometry now, so this is the natural next step. Strong math is essential for architecture. |
| Honors Chemistry | Honors | Standard sequence. Solid grade here shows STEM competence. |
| Spanish III (or other language) | Honors if available | Continue the sequence. |
| Art / Design Elective | Regular or Honors | **This is the new addition.** Whitman offers studio art, drawing, and potentially architecture or design electives. Get her into one. This is the first time the design thread appears on the transcript. If Whitman offers AP Art and Design, that's the target for junior or senior year. |

**Key academic note on MCPS course trajectory:** MCPS offers extensive AP options at Whitman. The course selection for 10th grade should position her to take 4-5 APs in junior year and 4-5 in senior year, which is competitive for the schools on her list. But the art/design elective is not optional. It's the first academic evidence of the spike.

**Extracurriculars:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Design/Architecture Independent Project | 5-8 | Start building the portfolio. Redesign a room, a public space, or a building entrance. Document everything: sketches, models, photos, written rationale. This becomes the core activity. |
| Soccer (JV or Varsity) | 8-10 (seasonal) | If she makes varsity, great. If she stays JV and enjoys it, that's fine too. This is physical and social. |
| Model UN (if she stays) | 3-4 | If she's engaged, stay and pursue a leadership role (chair, secretary-general track). If she's going through the motions, drop it. Her time is better spent on design. |
| Food Bank Volunteering | 2-3 | Continue. Consider connecting this to a design angle: how does the physical layout of a food bank affect efficiency and dignity for clients? That's design thinking applied to community service. |
| Art/Design Club or Independent Study | 3-5 | If Whitman has an architecture or art club, join. If not, propose one. An architecture club at Whitman, even with three members, looks better on the activities list than "member" of a 40-person club. |

**Milestones:**
- PSAT (October). This is diagnostic but also the qualifying test for National Merit Scholarship in 11th grade. A strong score here predicts SAT readiness.
- First design portfolio piece completed (a redesign project with documentation)
- Art/design elective on the transcript
- Summer program research begins (January-March applications for the summer after 10th grade)

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't take 4 APs as a sophomore to "look rigorous." Two APs plus all honors is the right level. Three APs in 10th grade is fine if she can handle it without burnout, but rigor without differentiation doesn't move the needle.
- Don't drop the design thread if it feels "less serious" than her other activities. It IS the strategy.
- Sarah, Ethan, don't compare her course load to the neighbor's kid. Whitman families do this obsessively. Nora absorbs your anxiety. If you're stressed about whether she's taking enough APs, she'll be stressed too.

---

### Summer After 10th Grade (Summer 2027)

This is the most strategically important summer. The design thread deepens. The pre-college programs matter.

**Design/Architecture Intensive (Priority #1):**

By now, Nora has had one summer of design exploration and one year of art/design coursework. If the interest is real (and based on what you've described, it will be), this is the summer she goes deeper:

- **Cornell AAP Summer Architecture Program:** A multi-week pre-college program at Cornell's architecture school. Students work in studios, learn design fundamentals, and experience the AAP environment. This is strategic: if she applies to Cornell AAP, having attended the summer program demonstrates serious interest. Tuition is approximately $5,000-7,000.
- **Carnegie Mellon Pre-College Architecture:** CM has a strong architecture program and a summer pre-college experience. If she's considering CM (it's worth adding to the research list), this exposure helps.
- **WashU Sam Fox Pre-College:** Similar to Cornell, a studio-based experience at WashU's design school. Demonstrates interest if she applies.
- **MICA Summer Intensive (advanced track):** If she attended MICA's introductory program the previous summer, the advanced track goes deeper into design studio work.
- **Intern or shadow at a DC architecture firm.** Real work. Even answering phones and organizing drawings. The experience and the reference letter have value.

Budget $3,000-7,000 for a residential pre-college program if possible. If cost is a barrier, the DC-area shadowing and local programs are free or low-cost alternatives that still build the portfolio.

**Academics:**
- SAT prep begins. Khan Academy is free and effective. If budget allows, a tutor or small-group prep course ($500-1,500) can help. Target the March or May SAT in junior year.
- Summer reading for AP courses (AP English Language, AP US History, or whatever she's taking in junior year).

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't replace the design program with a "leadership camp" or "business summer program." Those are filler. The architecture experience is the strategy.
- Don't start the Common App essay. Too early.

---

### 11th Grade (2027-2028)

This is the year that matters most. Junior year GPA is the most heavily weighted. SAT happens. AP exams happen. The college list takes shape. Everything accelerates.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| AP English Language & Composition | AP | Her strongest AP. Writing and argumentation. Target: a 5. This teacher becomes a key recommender. |
| AP U.S. History | AP | Connects to her understanding of how American spaces were designed, built, and contested. Strong content alignment. |
| Honors Pre-Calculus or AP Calculus AB | Honors or AP | Architecture requires math. If she's ready for AP Calc, take it. If not, Honors Pre-Calc protects the GPA and she takes AP Calc senior year. |
| AP Physics 1 or AP Environmental Science | AP | Physics is the better choice for architecture (structures, forces, materials). AP Environmental Science is the easier AP if GPA protection is the priority. |
| AP Art and Design (2D or Drawing) | AP | **This is critical.** The AP Art portfolio is the first formal, graded evidence of her design ability. A strong AP Art portfolio also serves as the foundation for her architecture supplement in college applications. |
| Spanish IV or AP Spanish | Honors or AP | Continue the language sequence. |

**That's 4-5 APs.** For Whitman, this is a rigorous but manageable load. Some Whitman students take 6-7 APs in junior year. Those students often burn out. Nora's schedule is strong and strategic: it shows rigor in humanities, competence in STEM, and commitment to the design thread through AP Art.

**SAT/ACT Prep:**

Start in the fall. Take the first SAT in March (March 2028).

Based on Nora's 95th percentile MAP score and strong academic record, here's the projection:

| Section | Optimistic | Realistic | Floor |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Evidence-Based Reading & Writing | 760+ | 730 | 700 |
| Math | 780+ | 740 | 700 |
| **Total** | **1540+** | **1470** | **1400** |

At every school on the list, a 1470+ is competitive. A 1540+ is above the median at all Ivies. The prep strategy is to protect what she's good at (reading/writing) and close any math gaps with targeted practice.

If the March SAT comes back under 1450, retake in June or October of senior year. If it's over 1500, she's done and should not take it again.

**Extracurriculars:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Design/Architecture Portfolio | 6-8 | The portfolio is now a body of work: 3-5 projects with documentation, sketches, models, and written rationale. This is what she'll submit as a supplement with her college applications. |
| Soccer (Varsity if she made it) | 8-10 (seasonal) | Last season if she's ready to stop. Or keep going. It's her call. |
| Community Design Project | 3-5 | This is where Thread 4 (Community and Perspective) comes alive. Can she volunteer with a community organization to redesign a shared space? A park, a community center, a library reading area? The intersection of design and community impact is the essay gold mine. |
| Model UN (leadership role) or new activity | 3-4 | If she stayed, she should be chairing conferences or leading the delegation by now. If she left, the time went to design. Either works. |
| Food Bank (continued, design angle) | 2-3 | If she proposed a redesign of the food bank layout for efficiency, that's a portfolio piece AND a community impact story. |

**Milestones:**
- PSAT/NMSQT (October). For National Merit Scholarship consideration. The cutoff in Maryland is typically around 1460-1480 (Selection Index). Nora's projected scores put her in range. National Merit Semi-Finalist is a significant honor that appears on the application.
- SAT, first attempt (March)
- AP exams (May): AP English Language, AP US History, AP Art, AP Physics/APES, AP Spanish
- Begin college list research and campus visits (spring). Visit UMD (it's 25 minutes away, no excuse). Visit Cornell AAP if possible (during the summer program, if she attends). Visit Georgetown if it's on the list.
- Summer pre-college program at a target architecture school

**What Not to Do:**
- Do not take the SAT more than twice. Diminishing returns after the second sitting. If her score is 1480+ on the first take, done.
- Do not let anyone convince her that AP Art and Design is "not a real AP." It absolutely is, and the portfolio she produces is the cornerstone of her architecture supplement.
- Ethan, Sarah, do not pay $5,000 for a private college counselor. You have this document. The $5,000 is better spent on a summer architecture program.
- Do not start writing college essays yet. Junior year is too early for final drafts. Let her keep designing, sketching, writing in her own voice. The essays come senior summer.

---

### 12th Grade (2028-2029)

Senior year is execution. The profile is built. The school list is set. The work now is essays, applications, portfolio finalization, and financial aid forms.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| AP English Literature & Composition | AP | Capstone English. This teacher may also be a recommender or reference. |
| AP Government and Politics | AP | Connects to the design-meets-community thread and Georgetown interest (if it stays on the list). |
| AP Calculus AB or BC | AP | Architecture requires math. If she took Pre-Calc in junior year, AP Calc AB is the right move. If she took AP Calc AB in junior year, BC adds depth. |
| AP Physics C or AP Biology | AP | If architecture is the path, AP Physics C is ideal (mechanics, structures). If she's pivoted away from architecture, AP Biology or another science is fine. |
| AP Studio Art (Portfolio concentration) | AP | If she didn't take AP Art in junior year, now. If she did, an advanced independent study in design or a second AP Art portfolio (3D Design) deepens the thread. |
| Elective | Any | Senior elective freedom. Architecture-related if available. |

**The senior year GPA matters.** Colleges see first-semester senior grades. A significant drop raises red flags. An upward trend helps. Keep the grades up through January.

**Extracurriculars (Maintenance, Not Expansion):**
- Design portfolio: final polish for college supplements
- Community design project: final impact, document everything
- Soccer: final season if she's playing
- Any leadership roles: final year, hand off to successors

---

### High School Course Progression (Full View)

| | English | Social Studies | Math | Science | Language | Art/Design | Other |
|---|---------|---------------|------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| **9th (current)** | English 9 Honors | AP Human Geography | Honors Geometry | Honors Biology | Spanish II | -- | Coding Club (dropping) |
| **10th** | English 10 Honors | AP World History | Honors Alg 2/Trig | Honors Chemistry | Spanish III | Art/Design Elective | -- |
| **11th** | AP English Language | AP US History | Honors Pre-Calc or AP Calc AB | AP Physics 1 or APES | Spanish IV or AP Spanish | AP Art and Design | -- |
| **12th** | AP English Literature | AP Government | AP Calc AB or BC | AP Physics C or AP Bio | -- (4 years completed) | AP Studio Art or Independent Study | Elective |

**Total APs over four years: 8-10** (Human Geo, World History, English Lang, US History, Physics/APES, Art, English Lit, Government, Calculus, possibly Spanish Language)

This is a rigorous schedule that plays to her strengths while building the design thread on the transcript. Colleges will see a student who challenged herself broadly and developed a specific design passion. That's exactly the right message.

---

## 2. Activities List (Common App Format)

The Common App allows 10 activities, listed in order of importance. Lead with what's most distinctive. These are projected for fall of senior year (2028) based on the roadmap above.

---

**Activity 1**
- **Type:** Art (Architecture/Design)
- **Position/Role:** Independent Designer / Portfolio Creator
- **Organization:** Independent
- **Description (150 chars):** Developed architecture and spatial design portfolio including 5+ projects: residential redesigns, public space proposals, community design projects. Work includes hand drawings, digital renderings, and physical models.
- **Grade Levels:** 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 7
- **Weeks/Year:** 45

*Why this is #1: This is Nora's spike. No other applicant from Whitman has a design portfolio. This is the activity that transforms her from "strong student" to "interesting person with a point of view about how the world should be built."*

---

**Activity 2**
- **Type:** Community Service (Volunteer)
- **Position/Role:** Lead Designer
- **Organization:** [Community Organization TBD], Bethesda/Montgomery County
- **Description (150 chars):** Partnered with community organization to redesign shared public space for improved accessibility and function. Led design process from needs assessment through presentation of final proposal to stakeholders.
- **Grade Levels:** 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 4
- **Weeks/Year:** 35

*Why this is #2: This connects the design thread to community impact. It shows that Nora's interest in architecture isn't abstract. She uses design thinking to solve real problems for real people.*

---

**Activity 3**
- **Type:** Academic
- **Position/Role:** Student
- **Organization:** [Pre-College Architecture Program, e.g., Cornell AAP Summer, WashU Sam Fox, or MICA]
- **Description (150 chars):** Selected for competitive pre-college architecture studio program. Completed intensive coursework in design fundamentals, model building, and architectural drawing. Produced capstone project.
- **Grade Levels:** 11
- **Hours/Week:** 40
- **Weeks/Year:** 2-6 (depending on program)

*Why this is #3: Pre-college programs at target schools demonstrate serious interest and provide external validation of talent.*

---

**Activity 4**
- **Type:** Athletics (Varsity or Club)
- **Position/Role:** Player (Varsity or JV)
- **Organization:** Walt Whitman High School Soccer
- **Description (150 chars):** Competed on soccer team since 5th grade. Contributed as midfielder/defender. Developed teamwork, discipline, and physical resilience across seven seasons.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 10
- **Weeks/Year:** 16 (seasonal)

*Why this is #4: Seven years of a sport shows commitment and balance. She's not just a studio kid. She's a well-rounded person who shows up for her team.*

---

**Activity 5**
- **Type:** Club
- **Position/Role:** Member or Officer
- **Organization:** Walt Whitman Model UN
- **Description (150 chars):** Participated in Model United Nations conferences, researching global policy issues and drafting position papers. Developed public speaking and negotiation skills through committee simulations.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11 (or 9, 10, 11, 12 if she continues)
- **Hours/Week:** 4
- **Weeks/Year:** 30

*Note: If Nora drops Model UN, this slot opens for another activity. If she stays and takes a leadership role (head delegate, secretary-general), it stays.*

---

**Activity 6**
- **Type:** Community Service (Volunteer)
- **Position/Role:** Volunteer
- **Organization:** [Food Bank Name], Montgomery County
- **Description (150 chars):** Volunteered monthly at food bank, sorting donations, assisting with distribution, and supporting operations. Proposed and implemented layout redesign to improve client flow and volunteer efficiency.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 2
- **Weeks/Year:** 40

*The layout redesign angle connects this to the design thread. If she can turn routine volunteering into a design intervention, it shows how her mind works.*

---

**Activity 7**
- **Type:** Art
- **Position/Role:** Student Artist
- **Organization:** Walt Whitman High School Art Department / AP Art and Design
- **Description (150 chars):** Completed AP Art and Design portfolio focused on spatial design and architecture. Exhibited work at school art show. Explored intersection of built environment and human experience through drawing, painting, and mixed media.

- **Weeks/Year:** 36

---

**Activity 8**
- **Type:** Club
- **Position/Role:** Founder or Co-Founder
- **Organization:** Whitman Architecture/Design Club
- **Description (150 chars):** Founded (or co-founded) student club exploring architecture, urban design, and spatial planning. Organized guest speakers from DC architecture firms, field trips to notable buildings, and collaborative design challenges.
- **Grade Levels:** 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 3
- **Weeks/Year:** 32

*Starting a club takes initiative. Even if it's small, "founder of Architecture Club" is a better line item than "member of 40-person Coding Club she doesn't care about."*

---

**Activity 9**
- **Type:** Academic / Research
- **Position/Role:** Researcher or Intern
- **Organization:** [DC Architecture Firm or Research Lab, TBD]
- **Description (150 chars):** Interned at architecture firm in Washington, DC. Assisted with project documentation, model building, and research on sustainable design materials. Gained exposure to professional architectural practice.
- **Grade Levels:** 11 or 12
- **Hours/Week:** 10-15
- **Weeks/Year:** 8-12 (summer)

*An internship at a real firm is the strongest possible evidence that the architecture interest is serious and not just a college application angle.*

---

**Activity 10**
- **Type:** Other (Personal/Hobby)
- **Position/Role:** Self-directed
- **Organization:** Independent
- **Description (150 chars):** Maintained independent sketchbook practice documenting architectural observations, spatial analysis of public and private spaces, and conceptual design ideas. Regular visitor to DC-area museums and architectural landmarks.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 3
- **Weeks/Year:** 50

*This is the "she sketches floor plans for fun" activity, formalized. It shows the admissions officer that this interest isn't new. It's how she's been seeing the world for years.*

## 3. Honors and Awards

Listed in order of prestige/distinctiveness. Projected year noted. Items marked [ASPIRATIONAL] require things to go well; items marked [LIKELY] are achievable with consistent effort; items marked [ACHIEVED] are already done.

1. **National Merit Semifinalist or Finalist** -- Projected: 12th grade (based on 11th grade PSAT) [LIKELY given MAP scores]. Maryland cutoff is approximately 1460-1480 Selection Index. Nora's projected PSAT performance puts her in range.

2. **AP Scholar with Distinction** -- Projected: 12th grade [LIKELY with 5+ AP exams averaging 3.5+]. Standard but expected at the Ivies. Absence would be noticed.

3. **Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, Regional Gold Key or Silver Key (Architecture/Design or Drawing)** -- Projected: 11th or 12th grade [ASPIRATIONAL]. Submitting AP Art portfolio work to Scholastic. A regional key is nationally recognized.

4. **Pre-College Architecture Program Certificate/Award** -- Projected: summer after 10th or 11th grade [LIKELY if she attends]. Completion of a selective pre-college program at Cornell, WashU, MICA, or similar.

5. **MCPS Gifted and Talented Identification** -- 3rd grade [ACHIEVED]. Already in the file. Establishes early academic identification.

6. **AP Human Geography: Score of 5** -- 9th grade [ACHIEVED]. Already done. Strong early AP performance.

7. **National Architecture Design Competition Winner/Finalist** -- Projected: 11th-12th grade [ASPIRATIONAL]. Competitions like the ACE Mentor Program, the AIAS (American Institute of Architecture Students) student design competitions, or the ULI (Urban Land Institute) UrbanPlan challenge. These are stretch goals but achievable for a student with a strong portfolio.

8. **Honor Roll, Every Semester** -- Ongoing [ACHIEVED/LIKELY]. Consistency signal.

9. **Varsity Letter (Soccer)** -- Projected: 10th-12th grade [LIKELY if she makes varsity]. A minor honor but shows athletic commitment.

10. **National Honor Society** -- Projected: 10th or 11th grade [LIKELY with 3.7+ GPA]. Standard. Expected.

## 4. Essay Strategy

The college essay is where Nora's application goes from competitive to memorable. The goal is to reveal who she is when she's not performing for a grade, not trying to impress, just being the person who sees spaces differently.

#### Common App Personal Essay

**The Angle: The Hirshhorn**

Sarah, you described a moment where Nora spent 45 minutes at the Hirshhorn Museum staring at the building itself while everyone else went inside to see the art. That's the essay.

Not "I want to be an architect" (too direct, too careerist for a personal essay). The essay is about the moment of seeing. About being the person who notices the building when everyone else notices the art inside it. About what it means to pay attention to the structures that shape our experience rather than just the experiences themselves.

The Hirshhorn is a perfect subject: it's a brutalist concrete cylinder on the National Mall, and people either love it or hate it. Nora apparently loves it. Why? What does she see? How does it make her feel? What does it tell her about herself that she's drawn to the structure rather than the gallery?

This essay does several things at once:
- It reveals her unique way of seeing the world (spatial, architectural, structural)
- It grounds her in a specific place (DC, the National Mall, the Hirshhorn)
- It introduces the design thread naturally, without being a resume-in-essay-form
- It differentiates her from every other Bethesda applicant writing about Model UN or community service

**What the essay should NOT be:**
- A "my activities taught me leadership" essay. Generic. Thousands of Whitman students have written this.
- A "I've always loved architecture since I was five" origin story. She hasn't. She's just discovering this. The essay should be about the moment of discovery, not a retrofitted narrative.
- A "how I overcame my anxiety" essay. Her perfectionism might come up naturally, but it should not be the thesis. Admissions officers read hundreds of anxiety essays.
- A "why I want to study architecture" essay. That's for the supplementals and the portfolio. The Common App essay is about who she is as a person, not what she wants to study.

**What it should feel like to read:** Like you're standing next to someone in a museum who sees something you don't, and by the end of the essay you're seeing it too.

## 5. Recommendation Letter Strategy

Nora needs two academic recommendation letters and can benefit from one supplemental letter. The goal is for the letters to collectively show three things: her intellectual depth, her design sensibility, and her character beneath the overachiever performance.

**Letter 1: AP English Language Teacher (11th Grade)**

This is the most important letter. This teacher will see Nora's best analytical writing during her most critical academic year. She should build a genuine relationship starting in September of junior year: participate in class, visit during office hours, share writing that goes beyond the assignments.

**What this letter should convey:** That Nora is not just a good student but a genuine thinker and writer. Ideally, the teacher notices that her writing has a spatial, visual quality, that she describes ideas in terms of structures, spaces, and environments. A specific example of insight or growth matters more than generic praise.

**When to ask:** Late April or early May of junior year. Provide a resume, activities list, and a short note about what she hopes the letter conveys.

**Letter 2: AP Physics Teacher or Math Teacher (11th Grade)**

The second letter should come from a STEM discipline to show breadth and to support the architecture narrative. Architecture is both art and science, and a letter from a math or physics teacher who can speak to Nora's quantitative skills and problem-solving approach complements the English teacher's letter.

**What this letter should convey:** That Nora applies analytical and quantitative thinking to design and spatial problems. If she makes connections in physics class between concepts (forces, structures, materials) and real-world architecture, that's the anecdote the teacher should write about.

**When to ask:** Same timeline. Late April/early May of junior year.

**Supplemental Letter: Architecture Mentor, Internship Supervisor, or Pre-College Program Instructor**

Many schools accept an additional recommendation. If Nora does a pre-college architecture program or an internship at a DC firm, the instructor or supervisor can speak to her design ability in a way that no high school teacher can.

**What this letter should convey:** Nora's spatial thinking, her design process, her ability to take and give critique in a studio environment, and her potential as a designer. This is the letter that makes the architecture thread real in the eyes of an admissions committee.

**When to ask:** End of the program or internship, while the relationship is fresh.

**What about Ms. Novak?** The 8th grade art teacher who said Nora has "a real eye for spatial design." Ms. Novak's observation is a powerful data point, but she's a middle school teacher. If a school accepts additional letters (some do), a short note from Ms. Novak could add historical context. But she should not replace either primary recommender.

---

## 6. Design/Architecture Portfolio Guidance

This is the section that makes Nora's application different from every other Whitman applicant. Several schools on the list accept or require design portfolios, and even those that don't require one will benefit from seeing evidence of her spatial thinking.

**Portfolio Requirements by School:**

| School | Portfolio Required? | Submission Method |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cornell AAP (B.Arch) | Strongly encouraged / effectively required | SlideRoom via Common App |
| WashU Sam Fox | Strongly encouraged for Sam Fox applicants | SlideRoom |
| UMD Architecture | Encouraged for direct architecture admission | School-specific portal |
| Northeastern Architecture | Encouraged | SlideRoom |
| UVA Architecture | Encouraged for School of Architecture | School-specific portal |
| Harvard, Penn, Columbia, Brown | Accepted as arts supplement (optional) | SlideRoom via Common App |
| Georgetown, Hopkins, Tufts | Arts supplement possible but less formal | Varies |

**What the Portfolio Should Include (by senior fall):**

Aim for 15-20 pieces that demonstrate a range of skills and thinking:

- **3-4 observational drawings:** Hand-drawn sketches of buildings, streetscapes, interior spaces. Show that she can see and record the built environment accurately. Pen, pencil, charcoal all work.
- **2-3 conceptual design projects:** Original designs with clear intent. A room redesign, a public space proposal, a small building concept. Include process sketches, not just final renderings. Schools want to see how she thinks, not just what she produces.
- **1-2 physical models:** Photographed from multiple angles with good lighting. Cardboard, foam core, basswood, or 3D printed. Models show three-dimensional thinking that drawings alone can't demonstrate.
- **1-2 digital explorations:** If she learns SketchUp, AutoCAD, Rhino, or any 3D modeling software (many are free for students), include one or two digital pieces. This is not required but demonstrates technical curiosity.
- **2-3 pieces from AP Art and Design portfolio:** Her strongest work from the AP portfolio, especially pieces that show spatial awareness and design thinking.
- **1 community design project documentation:** If she does the community space redesign, include the before/after, the process, and the impact. This piece is gold for supplements because it shows design as service.
- **A brief artist statement:** 150-250 words about how she thinks about space, design, and the built environment. Not a resume. A window into her mind.

**Portfolio Building Timeline:**

| When | What |
|------|------|
| Summer before 10th grade | First sketches, first design exploration. Messy is fine. |
| 10th grade | Art elective produces 3-5 pieces. Independent projects add 2-3 more. |
| Summer after 10th grade | Pre-college program produces 3-5 pieces. Internship/shadow adds observational work. |
| 11th grade | AP Art portfolio produces 8-12 pieces. Community project adds 2-3. |
| Summer after 11th grade | Portfolio curation and final polish. Photograph everything. Write artist statement. |
| Fall of 12th grade | Submit via SlideRoom or school-specific portals. |

**What NOT to Include:**
- Pieces that are purely decorative or abstract without a design/spatial focus (unless they're extraordinary)
- Unfinished work (better to show 15 strong pieces than 20 with filler)
- Work that looks like it was done by a parent, tutor, or AI. Admissions reviewers can tell.

**Technical Tips:**
- Photograph work in natural light against a neutral background
- Include process images (sketches, iterations) alongside final pieces
- Label each piece with title, medium, dimensions, date, and a one-sentence description
- Organize digitally in a consistent format (PDF or SlideRoom will specify)

## 7. Financial Aid Negotiation Guide

When financial aid offers arrive in March and April, you'll need to compare them carefully and potentially negotiate. Here's how.

**How to Compare Offers Side by Side:**

Create a spreadsheet with these columns for each school:

| Column | What to Include |
|--------|----------------|
| School Name | -- |
| Total Cost of Attendance | Tuition + fees + room + board + books + personal expenses |
| Grants/Scholarships (free money) | Institutional grants, federal grants, outside scholarships |
| Net Cost (COA minus free money) | This is what you actually pay |
| Loans in the Package | Subsidized, unsubsidized, PLUS offered |
| Work-Study | Amount offered |
| True Out-of-Pocket (Net Cost minus 529 contribution) | After you apply 529 funds |
| Home Equity Treatment | Did this school count it? At what cap? |

**When and How to Negotiate:**

1. **Wait until you have all offers.** Don't negotiate with one school before you've heard from all of them. You need leverage.
2. **Identify the gap.** If Harvard offers $23K/year and Cornell offers $30K/year, the gap is $7K/year. That gap is almost certainly driven by home equity treatment. You know this. Use it.
3. **Call, don't email.** Phone calls to financial aid offices are more effective than written appeals. Be direct: "We're comparing our financial aid offers and we'd like to discuss our package."
4. **Share competing offers.** "Harvard's financial aid formula produced a family contribution of $23,000/year. Your formula produced $30,000. The difference appears to be driven by home equity treatment. Is there flexibility in how your institution assesses home equity for families in our situation?"
5. **Document any changes in circumstances.** If your financial situation changes between filing and receiving offers (job loss, medical expenses, unexpected costs), file a professional judgment appeal with documentation.
6. **Schools with known flexibility:** Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are known for being responsive to professional judgment appeals. WashU has been increasingly flexible. Georgetown and Northeastern have less flexibility because their endowments are smaller.
7. **Schools with less flexibility:** Public universities (UMD, UVA) have more rigid formulas. Don't expect UMD to match an Ivy offer. They don't have the endowment.

**The Specific Lever for Your Family:**

Your strongest negotiation card is the home equity treatment variation. If Harvard excludes your $540K in home equity and another school includes it, you have a concrete, mathematical argument: "Our family's home is our primary residence, not a liquid asset. We cannot access this equity to pay for college without selling our home. Harvard's formula recognizes this. We're asking whether your institution can adjust its treatment of home equity for our family."

This doesn't always work. But at schools with professional judgment authority (most private schools that meet full need), it's worth asking every time.

**When to Walk Away:**

If a school cannot get the annual cost below your budget after negotiation, accept the school that can. Brand loyalty is not worth $40,000 in parent PLUS loans. Ethan, Sarah, you know this intellectually. In April, when Nora is in love with a school that costs $45K/year, you'll need to know it emotionally too.

## 9. External Scholarships

These are outside scholarships that supplement institutional aid. They don't replace school aid but they can cover remaining out-of-pocket costs.

| Scholarship | Amount | Deadline | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| National Merit Scholarship | $2,500 (one-time) or corporate-sponsored up to full tuition | Automatic via PSAT | If Nora qualifies as Semifinalist, she's automatically considered. Corporate sponsors (check Ethan's firm and Sarah's NIH-adjacent organizations) may offer additional awards. |
| Banneker/Key Scholarship (UMD) | Partial to full tuition + stipend | Automatic with UMD application | UMD's premier merit award. Nora's profile is competitive. |
| AIA (American Institute of Architects) Scholarships | $500-10,000 | Varies by chapter | Local DC/MD chapter and national AIA offer scholarships for aspiring architecture students. |
| ACE Mentor Program Scholarship | $2,000-10,000 | Spring of senior year | Architecture, Construction, Engineering mentoring program. Check if Montgomery County has a chapter. |
| Coca-Cola Scholars Program | $20,000 | October of senior year | Leadership and community service focused. Nora's community design work fits. |
| Elks Most Valuable Student | Up to $12,500/year | November of senior year | Academics, leadership, financial need. |
| Questbridge | N/A | N/A | **Not applicable.** Family income too high. |
| Montgomery County Community Foundation | Various ($1,000-5,000) | Spring | Local scholarships for MC students. Check their website starting fall of senior year. |
| NIH-affiliated scholarships | Various | Varies | Sarah, check whether NIH or DHHS offers dependent scholarships. Some federal agencies do. |
| Jewish community scholarships | Various | Varies | Check with your synagogue, the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, and Hillel. Many offer scholarships to Jewish students. |
| NCARB (Architecture licensing board) | Various | Varies | Scholarships for students entering architecture programs. |

Sarah, Ethan, scholarship applications take time. Choose 8-10 that fit Nora's profile and invest in quality applications. The Banneker/Key at UMD is the biggest potential win because it's automatic with the application and could reduce UMD's cost to near zero.

---

## 10. Monte Carlo Parameter Table

The table below feeds into the financial simulation in Phase 2. Each number is an estimate based on published admission rates (Common Data Set where available), institutional financial aid policies, and adjustments for Nora's projected profile. These are not guarantees. They are informed inputs. Where I'm guessing, I'll say so.

**How to read the adjustments:** Published admit rates are for all applicants. Nora's profile includes factors that adjust the baseline:

- **Whitman/MCPS pedigree:** Neutral to slightly positive. Admissions officers know Whitman. They can contextualize her transcript. But Whitman also sends many applicants to these schools, so she's competing against classmates.
- **Design/architecture spike (if developed):** Positive at schools with architecture programs (Cornell AAP, WashU Sam Fox, UMD, UVA, Northeastern). Differentiating at schools without formal programs (Harvard, Brown, Columbia, Tufts). This is the single biggest variable in her admit probability.
- **White/Jewish female from affluent suburb:** Neutral to slightly negative at the most selective schools. This is the most overrepresented demographic in selective college applicants. There is no hook here.
- **Strong academics (3.9 GPA, projected 1500+ SAT):** Table stakes at these schools. Gets her past the initial screening but doesn't differentiate.
- **Family income ($235K):** No impact on admission at need-blind schools (all Ivies, Georgetown, Hopkins, WashU, Tufts). Potential slight negative at need-aware schools (Northeastern, which is not fully need-blind).

### Parameter Table

| School | Tier | Published Admit Rate | Adjusted Admit (Nora) | P(Merit Scholarship) | Merit Amount (Annual) | P(Honors) | Est. Net Cost/Year (at $235K income) | Home Equity Impact |
|--------|------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Harvard | Reach | 3.5% | 6% | N/A (need-based only) | N/A | N/A | $20,000-25,000 | Excluded |
| Penn | Reach | 5.4% | 8% | N/A (need-based only) | N/A | N/A | $22,000-28,000 | Included (full) |
| Columbia | Reach | 3.9% | 5% | N/A (need-based only) | N/A | N/A | $22,000-28,000 | Included (aggressive) |
| Brown | Reach | 5.0% | 7% | N/A (need-based only) | N/A | N/A | $20,000-25,000 | Included (capped) |
| Cornell AAP | Reach | 10% (AAP) | 14% | N/A (need-based only) | N/A | N/A | $22,000-28,000 | Included |
| Georgetown | Reach | 12% | 15% | 10% | $10,000 | N/A | $40,000-52,000 | Included (full) |
| Johns Hopkins | Target-Reach | 6.5% | 10% | 5% | $8,000 | 15% | $25,000-35,000 | Included |
| WashU (Sam Fox) | Target-Reach | 11% | 15% | 10% | $12,000 | N/A | $22,000-28,000 | Capped (1.2x income) |
| Tufts | Target | 10% | 14% | 5% | $8,000 | N/A | $24,000-32,000 | Included |
| UVA (OOS) | Target | 18% (OOS) | 22% | 10% (Jefferson) | $10,000 | 20% | $28,000-38,000 | FAFSA only (no impact) |
| Northeastern | Target | 5% | 8% | 25% | $15,000 | 10% (Dean's) | $28,000-40,000 | Included |
| UMD Honors | Safety | 45% (20% Honors) | 90% (UMD), 60% (Honors) | 50% (Banneker/Key partial), 15% (full) | $5,000-$14,000 | 60% | $12,000-15,000 | FAFSA only (no impact) |

**Notes on the table:**

- "Need-based only" schools (all Ivies, Hopkins, WashU, Tufts) don't offer traditional merit scholarships. They calculate your need and cover it with grants. At $235K income, the expected family contribution is substantial, and the variation between schools is driven by how they treat your home equity and retirement savings.
- Georgetown's high estimated cost reflects its weaker endowment. It simply cannot match the Ivies dollar for dollar.
- Cornell AAP's adjusted rate of 14% reflects the portfolio boost. Without a portfolio, her odds at Cornell drop to ~8%, similar to the other Ivies.
- WashU's home equity cap at 1.2x income means they'd cap your home equity assessment at roughly $282,000, not the full $540,000. This saves you approximately $5,000-8,000/year compared to schools that count full home equity.
- UMD is modeled with separate probabilities for general admission (very likely), Honors admission (likely), and Banneker/Key scholarship (aspirational for full, likely for partial).
- Northeastern's higher merit probability reflects their practice of using merit awards to attract strong students, even when they don't fully meet need.
- The "without design spike" scenario would reduce Cornell AAP's adjusted rate from 14% to ~8% and WashU Sam Fox from 15% to ~11%. The design thread is worth approximately 3-5 percentage points at architecture-focused schools.

**Assumptions I'm making:**

1. These admit rates are based on 2023-2025 published data. By 2028-2029, rates could shift. They've been trending downward.
2. Nora hits the "optimistic" profile: 3.9+ GPA, 1480+ SAT, strong design portfolio, meaningful extracurriculars. If she lands at a "realistic" level (3.7 GPA, 1430 SAT, weaker portfolio), subtract 2-3 percentage points from each adjusted rate.
3. The design/architecture thread is developed as described in this plan. Without it, she's in the undifferentiated pool, and every adjusted rate drops significantly.
4. Home equity remains approximately $540K. If your home value increases or you refinance to reduce equity, the CSS Profile numbers change.
5. Financial aid policies remain roughly stable. Endowments grow, policies evolve. Verify current policies before filing.
