# The Scaffold Strategy

## A College Planning Blueprint for Jaylen Washington

*Prepared for Maya Washington | Atlanta, GA | February 2026*
*Class of 2030 | North Atlanta High School (APS)*

---

## Executive Summary

**Jaylen at a glance:** Rising 9th grader, 3.7 GPA, 88th percentile in reading, 71st in math. Strongest assets are his writing (MLK contest placement, personal journal since 6th grade, Scholastic potential) and debate (new but already passionate). Main vulnerability is math, which will limit test scores if not addressed. Projected SAT range: 1230-1340. First-generation four-year college student, single-parent household, $72K income.

**The School List:**

| School | Tier | Est. Net Cost/Year | Financial Risk |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Vanderbilt | Reach | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| Emory | Reach | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| Howard | Reach | $8,000-22,000 | High |
| Davidson | Target | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| Morehouse | Target | $8,000-20,000 | Moderate-High |
| UGA Honors | Target | $5,000-11,500 | Very Low |
| Denison | Target | $3,000-5,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| U of Richmond | Target | $3,000-5,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| Georgia State | Safety | $0-10,500 | Essentially Zero |
| Clark Atlanta | Safety | $8,000-20,000 | Moderate |

**Top 3 things to do in the next 6 months:**

1. **Get Jaylen a math tutor this summer.** Twice a week, six weeks minimum. Khan Academy is free. A local tutor through church or APS runs $0-500. This is the single highest-leverage move for his test scores and GPA trajectory.
2. **Make sure he's registered for Honors English and AP Human Geography at North Atlanta.** If the school tries to put him in standard English, push back. His 88th percentile reading score and MLK contest placement justify Honors. Call the counselor before August.
3. **Get him connected to the Atlanta Urban Debate League (AUDL) and North Atlanta's debate team before the first day of school.** If there's a summer workshop or pre-season meeting, he should be there. Debate is the extracurricular anchor of this entire plan.

**The financial floor:** Georgia State University with HOPE Scholarship. Admission probability: ~85%. Estimated net cost: $4,500/year as a commuter, $10,500/year residential. This outcome is available in nearly every simulation and is well under your $15,000/year cap. If every other school falls through or comes in over budget, Georgia State with HOPE is a good outcome, not a consolation prize.

**The headline number:** Across 10,000 simulated scenarios, the median total cost for four years of college is **$16,000**. There is a **92% chance** that at least one school on this list comes in under your $15,000/year budget.


## Before We Start

Maya, you said something in your intake that I want to address right away: "I don't know how any of this works." That's fine. Most families don't. The ones who seem like they know what they're doing usually just started Googling earlier, or they have a neighbor who went through it. You're doing the right thing by starting now, before Jaylen's first day of high school. That gives you four years to be strategic instead of reactive.

Here's what this document is and what it isn't.

**It is:** A specific, data-informed plan for Jaylen's next four years, built around your finances, your geography, your schools, and the kid you've described to me. It includes a year-by-year roadmap, a college list, an application strategy, and a financial simulation that models 10,000 scenarios so you can see what's actually likely, not just what's possible.

**It isn't:** A guarantee. Plans change. Kids change. Jaylen might discover a passion for marine biology next year, or decide debate is stupid, or pull his math grade up to an A and blow past what I'm projecting here. Good. This document is a scaffold (the name is intentional), not a cage. It gives you a framework for making decisions. You'll adjust it as you go.

A few things I want to be honest about before we get into it:

1. **Jaylen's profile is strong but not elite yet.** A 3.7 GPA, strong writing skills, 2nd place in a city-wide contest, and a new debate obsession is a great starting point. But "great starting point" is different from "locks up Vanderbilt." The next four years will determine where he lands, and the plan below is designed to move him from good to genuinely competitive.

2. **Your financial constraint is real and I'm going to respect it.** You said $3,000-5,000 per year out of pocket, hard cap at $15,000. I hear you. I'm not going to put dream schools on the list and hope for the best. Every school on this list has a realistic path to affordability at your income level. Some of them will be surprisingly cheap. A few will be risky. I'll tell you which is which.

3. **The biggest financial tool available to your family is one you haven't heard of.** It's called QuestBridge. I'll explain it in detail below. Keep reading. For now, just know that it exists specifically for families like yours, and it changes the math on schools you'd otherwise assume are out of reach.

4. **Math is the weak link and we need to address it.** Not because Jaylen needs to be a math kid, but because a 71st percentile in math will limit his test scores, his course rigor, and his competitiveness at selective schools. The plan includes specific steps to shore this up. It doesn't require him to love math. It requires him to get competent enough that it's not holding back the rest of his profile.

5. **His writing is the asset that most families would kill for.** A kid who keeps a journal of poems and essays since 6th grade, who wrote about the Tulsa Race Massacre well enough to place in a city-wide contest, who "thinks in questions, not answers" according to his teacher? That's not common. That's the thing we build the entire application narrative around.

Let's get into it.

---

## The Four Threads

Every strong college application tells a coherent story. Not a fabricated one, a real one. Looking at Jaylen's profile, four threads emerge naturally. Everything in this roadmap is designed to deepen these threads, not scatter his energy across fifteen unrelated activities.

**Thread 1: Voice.** Jaylen writes. He argues. He holds a classroom discussion better than most adults. This thread runs through debate, creative writing, journalism, and eventually his college essays. It's the centerpiece.

**Thread 2: Community.** The book drive. The church youth ministry. Growing up in Pittsburgh and choosing to invest in his neighborhood instead of just escaping it. This thread connects his values to action.

**Thread 3: Intellectual Curiosity (Humanities).** History, James Baldwin, the Tulsa Race Massacre essay, the abandoned houses poem. He's drawn to stories, to understanding why things are the way they are. This points toward English, history, political science, African American studies, or journalism as potential college paths.

**Thread 4: Leadership through Service.** Not the "I was president of five clubs" kind of leadership. The "I saw a problem and did something about it" kind. The book drive is the seed. We grow it.

These four threads will guide every decision below: which activities to prioritize, which courses to take, which summer programs to pursue, and how to frame the application.

## About QuestBridge (Read This Carefully)

Maya, you said you've heard of QuestBridge but don't really understand how it works. Let me break it down, because this is the single most important financial strategy for your family.

**What QuestBridge is:** A national nonprofit that connects high-achieving students from low-income families with full four-year scholarships at the country's top colleges. It's not a loan. It's not partial aid. It's a full ride: tuition, room, board, books, and travel. Four years. No loans in the package.

**How it works (two stages):**

**Stage 1: College Prep Scholars (Junior Year)**
- Apply in the spring of 11th grade (deadline is typically late March)
- If named a College Prep Scholar, Jaylen gets access to college fly-in programs (free campus visits), mentoring, application fee waivers, and a pipeline into the National College Match
- This is an honor itself that looks great on applications
- Being named CPS does not guarantee a Match, but it significantly helps

**Stage 2: National College Match (Senior Year)**
- Apply in September of 12th grade
- Jaylen ranks up to 12 QuestBridge partner colleges (in order of preference)
- Partner colleges review his application and decide whether to "match" with him
- If he matches, he gets a full four-year scholarship to that school. It's binding (like Early Decision), but the scholarship is guaranteed
- Match results come in late November/early December
- If he doesn't match, his application is automatically forwarded to the Regular Decision pool at those schools. He loses nothing.

**Who qualifies:** Generally, families earning under $65,000-75,000/year with limited assets. At $72,000 with a single income, one sibling, and $8,000 in savings, Jaylen is a strong candidate. The home equity ($120K) is noted but typically doesn't disqualify applicants, especially with your overall financial picture.

**QuestBridge partner schools on Jaylen's list:**
- Vanderbilt University
- Emory University
- Davidson College
- Denison University
- University of Richmond

That's five schools where Jaylen could potentially get a full four-year scholarship through the Match. These are the financial home runs.

**The strategic implication:** QuestBridge is why schools like Vanderbilt and Emory, which have $60,000+/year sticker prices, are actually among the cheapest options for your family. I know that sounds backwards. It's true. A school that meets full demonstrated need at your income level will cost you less than a school with a lower sticker price that leaves gaps in your aid package. This is the most counterintuitive thing in college finance, and it's the thing that most first-gen families miss.

## The School List

Ten schools. Three reaches, four targets, three safeties. Every school on this list has a realistic path to costing your family $15,000/year or less. Some will cost much less than that. A few have financial risk that I'll flag explicitly.

The list is organized by tier (reach, target, safety), not by preference. The right school for Jaylen will depend on which ones admit him and what they offer financially. You'll make that decision in April of senior year with real numbers in hand.

---

#### REACHES

These are schools where admission is uncertain but possible, and where the financial payoff if admitted is very strong.

---

**1. Vanderbilt University**
*Nashville, TN | ~5% admit rate | ~7,000 undergrads | QuestBridge Partner*

**Why it's on the list:** Vanderbilt's Opportunity Vanderbilt program guarantees that 100% of demonstrated financial need is met with grants, not loans. At your income level, the net cost would be approximately $2,000-4,000/year (mostly fees, books, and travel). That makes Vanderbilt, with its $62,000/year sticker price, one of the cheapest schools on this list if Jaylen gets in.

**Academic fit:** Strong humanities programs, particularly in English, Political Science, and African American & Diaspora Studies. The College of Arts & Science is the right home. The debate and forensics program is active.

**Cultural fit:** Nashville is a real city with a significant Black community. Vanderbilt has been working to diversify, and the student body is more diverse than its reputation suggests (though it's still a predominantly white, affluent campus). The Bishop Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center is a hub. Jaylen would not be the only Black kid from a public school, but he'd be in the minority.

**The honest truth:** At ~5% admission, this is a long shot for anyone. QuestBridge Match improves his odds meaningfully (the Match acceptance rate is higher than the general rate for QB finalists). If he matches here, take it immediately. Don't think twice.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,000-4,000/year | **4-year total:** $8,000-16,000

---

**2. Emory University**
*Atlanta, GA | ~11% admit rate | ~7,000 undergrads | QuestBridge Partner*

**Why it's on the list:** Emory is right here in Atlanta, 20 minutes from your house. It meets 100% of demonstrated financial need. The Emory Advantage program eliminates loans from financial aid packages for families earning under $75,000. That's you.

**Academic fit:** Excellent English, Creative Writing, and Political Science departments. Strong pre-law advising (if debate points him in that direction). The Center for Humanistic Inquiry is a major resource. Emory's smaller class sizes mean Jaylen would get the kind of faculty attention that a big state school can't offer.

**Cultural fit:** Emory is in Druid Hills/Decatur, which is a very different Atlanta than Pittsburgh. But the campus has a meaningful Black student population and active cultural organizations. The James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference is nationally respected. And the proximity to home means Sunday cooking doesn't have to stop.

**The honest truth:** Emory's admit rate has dropped significantly in recent years. It's a reach. But as a local student, first-gen, Black male from APS with a strong humanities profile, Jaylen brings something Emory is actively looking for. The QuestBridge pathway further improves his odds.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,000-4,000/year | **4-year total:** $8,000-16,000

---

**3. Howard University**
*Washington, DC | ~30% admit rate | ~6,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Howard is the HBCU that defined what an HBCU could be. The campus is in the heart of DC. The humanities tradition (Toni Morrison taught there, Ta-Nehisi Coates studied there) is exactly where Jaylen's interests live. The debate team is competitive. The cultural environment would surround Jaylen with high-achieving Black peers in a way that no PWI on this list can replicate.

**Academic fit:** English, Political Science, African American Studies, and Communications are all strong. Howard's Honors Program adds rigor and community. The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center is one of the most important archives of Black history in the world.

**Cultural fit:** This is the best cultural fit on the entire list. Full stop. Jaylen would be around Black excellence at every level, with professors who look like him, peers who share his experience, and an institutional history that validates everything he cares about. The comparison Ms. Coleman made to her Morehouse students? Howard carries that same energy on a larger scale.

**The honest truth, and this is the hard part:** Howard does not consistently meet full demonstrated financial need. Their endowment, while growing, is smaller than the elite PWIs on this list. This means the gap between what Howard says you can afford and what you can actually afford might be significant. At $72,000 income, without merit scholarships, the net cost could be $18,000-22,000/year, which is over your cap.

Howard offers competitive merit scholarships (the Capstone Scholarship, the Founders Scholarship, various departmental awards), and Jaylen's profile would make him a strong candidate. But merit is not guaranteed. The financial risk here is real.

**Strategy:** Apply, compete for merit, and compare the offer against other schools in April. If Howard can get the cost under $15,000/year, it's a strong choice. If they can't, it may not be feasible, and that's OK. I'd rather tell you that now than have you fall in love with an offer you can't afford.

**Estimated net cost:** $8,000-22,000/year (wide range, depends entirely on merit) | **4-year total:** $32,000-88,000

**Financial risk: HIGH.** This is the one school on the list that could break your budget. Apply, but go in with eyes open.

#### TARGETS

These are schools where admission is likely (not guaranteed) and where the financial picture is favorable.

---

**4. Davidson College**
*Davidson, NC (near Charlotte) | ~17% admit rate | ~2,000 undergrads | QuestBridge Partner*

**Why it's on the list:** Davidson meets 100% of demonstrated financial need with no loans in the package. At your income, the net cost is roughly $2,000-4,000/year. It's a QuestBridge partner. And it's one of the strongest liberal arts colleges in the South.

**Academic fit:** Small classes (average 14 students), tight student-faculty relationships, and a genuine intellectual culture. The English and Political Science departments are excellent. Davidson's emphasis on writing across the curriculum means Jaylen's skill set would be valued in every class, not just English. The debate and forensics program is active for a school this size.

**Cultural fit:** This is where it gets complicated. Davidson is a small, historically white school in a small town outside Charlotte. The student body is more diverse than it used to be (about 25% students of color), but Jaylen would be one of relatively few Black students in his classes. The campus is not Atlanta. It's not a city. It's a quiet college town.

That said, Davidson students tend to be serious, thoughtful, and engaged. For a kid who "thinks in questions, not answers," the intellectual environment could be transformative. Charlotte is 20 minutes away for when he needs a city. And the financial aid is among the best in the country.

**The honest truth:** If Jaylen matches here through QuestBridge, it's a free education at a top-25 liberal arts college. The cultural adjustment would be real, but the academic and financial outcome would be outstanding.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,000-4,000/year | **4-year total:** $8,000-16,000

---

**5. Morehouse College**
*Atlanta, GA | ~48% admit rate | ~2,200 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Ms. Coleman said Jaylen reminds her of students she had when she taught at Morehouse. You mentioned Morehouse first on your list. There's a reason this school is on everyone's mind. Morehouse is the most prestigious HBCU for men in the country, it's in Atlanta, and it produces more Black male leaders per capita than almost any institution in America.

**Academic fit:** Strong in English, Political Science, and the humanities broadly. The Morehouse debate team competes nationally. The Crown Forum speaker series brings world-class voices to campus. The proximity to the Atlanta University Center (Spelman, Clark Atlanta, Morehouse School of Medicine) means he can cross-register for courses.

**Cultural fit:** Possibly the best cultural fit on the list alongside Howard. Every student is a Black man. The brotherhood, the mentoring, the tradition of excellence. For a kid who needs strong male role models (your words, not mine), Morehouse provides that structurally, not just incidentally.

**The honest truth:** Like Howard, Morehouse does not always meet full demonstrated need. The endowment has been growing (a $100 million gift from Reed Hastings in 2024 and the Bloomberg Scholars program help), but gaps remain. At your income without merit, the net cost could be $15,000-22,000/year.

However, Morehouse offers strong merit scholarships, and recent endowment growth is improving aid packages. Jaylen's profile (strong GPA, debate, writing, community service, first-gen) makes him competitive for merit. The Bloomberg Scholars program specifically targets students with financial need.

**Strategy:** Same as Howard. Apply, compete aggressively for merit, and evaluate the financial package in April. If they get it under $15,000/year, seriously consider it. If they can't, you have options that are cheaper and still excellent.

**Estimated net cost:** $8,000-20,000/year (depends on merit) | **4-year total:** $32,000-80,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE to HIGH.** Better than Howard's financial outlook due to recent endowment growth, but still not guaranteed to meet your cap.

---

**6. University of Georgia, Honors Program**
*Athens, GA | ~42% admit rate (Honors is more selective) | ~30,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** This is your financial safety net, and I don't mean that as a consolation. UGA is a top-20 public university with a legitimate Honors program that gives Jaylen a small-college experience inside a big university. And as a Georgia resident, the cost is unbeatable.

**The HOPE and Zell Miller math:**
- **HOPE Scholarship:** Requires a 3.0+ GPA (high school and maintained in college). Covers tuition at any Georgia public institution. At UGA, that's roughly $12,000/year in tuition covered.
- **Zell Miller Scholarship:** Requires a 3.7+ GPA AND a 1200+ SAT (or 26+ ACT). Covers full tuition plus fees. This is the gold standard for Georgia residents.

| Scenario | Tuition | Room/Board | Fees | Scholarships | Pell Grant | Need-Based | **Net Cost** |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Zell Miller + need-based | $12,000 | $11,500 | $2,500 | -$14,500 (Zell) | -$2,500 | -$4,000 | **~$5,000/yr** |
| HOPE + need-based | $12,000 | $11,500 | $2,500 | -$12,000 (HOPE) | -$2,500 | -$4,000 | **~$7,500/yr** |
| HOPE only (no need-based) | $12,000 | $11,500 | $2,500 | -$12,000 (HOPE) | -$2,500 | $0 | **~$11,500/yr** |

All three scenarios are under your $15,000 cap. Zell Miller is the target, but HOPE alone is still very affordable.

**Academic fit:** The Honors program is small (~2,000 students in a 30,000-student university) with priority registration, smaller classes, and a dedicated community. The English and History departments are strong. UGA's Grady College of Journalism is one of the best in the country if Jaylen's writing leads him toward media.

**Cultural fit:** UGA is a large, majority-white university in a college town. Athens has a vibrant culture and music scene. The Black student population (~8%) is smaller proportionally than at the HBCUs, but the absolute numbers mean there's a real community. The Black Affairs Council, NAACP chapter, and various Black Greek organizations are active.

**The honest truth:** UGA is probably not where Jaylen's heart leads him if he has a choice. But it might be where the math leads. And that's not a bad thing. Athens is a fantastic college town. The Honors program is rigorous. The cost is almost impossible to beat. If every reach and target falls through or comes in over budget, UGA with HOPE or Zell Miller is an outcome you should feel genuinely good about.

**Estimated net cost:** $5,000-11,500/year | **4-year total:** $20,000-46,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.** HOPE requires only a 3.0 GPA, which is well within reach.

---

**7. Denison University**
*Granville, OH (25 min from Columbus) | ~31% admit rate | ~2,300 undergrads | QuestBridge Partner*

**Why it's on the list:** Denison is a hidden gem for students like Jaylen. It's a QuestBridge partner with extremely generous financial aid (they meet 100% of demonstrated need for most students). The English and Creative Writing programs are nationally recognized. And the emphasis on mentoring and community fits a kid who thrives with personal attention.

**Academic fit:** Denison's English and Creative Writing departments are among the strongest at any liberal arts college. The Lisska Center for Scholarly Engagement supports undergraduate research and creative projects. The school's emphasis on writing across disciplines means Jaylen's skills transfer everywhere.

**Cultural fit:** I know what you're thinking. Granville, Ohio? It's a small town. But it's 25 minutes from Columbus, which is a real city with a significant Black population. Denison's campus is more diverse than many comparable schools (~30% domestic students of color), and the Multicultural Student Union and Posse Scholars program create a meaningful community.

Still, it's not Atlanta. For a city kid, the adjustment is real. I'd recommend a campus visit if Denison stays on the list.

**The honest truth:** Denison flies under the radar because it doesn't have the name recognition of an Emory or Morehouse. But the financial aid is better than most schools twice its ranking, and the academic experience is genuinely excellent. A QuestBridge Match here would be a full ride at a school that would pour resources into Jaylen's development as a writer and thinker.

**Estimated net cost:** $3,000-5,000/year | **4-year total:** $12,000-20,000

---

**8. University of Richmond**
*Richmond, VA | ~24% admit rate | ~3,200 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Richmond meets 100% of demonstrated financial need. At your income, the net cost would be approximately $3,000-5,000/year. It's in a mid-size city with deep American history (which Jaylen would love). And the Richmond Guarantee funds every student's summer internship or research project, which is a major post-graduation advantage.

**Academic fit:** Strong English, Rhetoric & Communication, and Leadership Studies programs. Small classes, accessible faculty. The Bonner Center for Civic Engagement connects students with community-based work, which aligns with Jaylen's service thread. The Jepson School of Leadership Studies is unique in the country and fits a kid who leads through action.

**Cultural fit:** Richmond, Virginia is a complicated city with a deep racial history. For Jaylen, that history is a feature, not a bug. The campus is more diverse than many peer schools (~25% students of color), and the proximity to a city with a large Black population helps. It's not Atlanta, but it's also not a rural campus.

**The honest truth:** Richmond doesn't have the name recognition of the other schools on this list, but dollar for dollar, it may be the best value. Full-need met, in a real city, with guaranteed internship funding, at a school that emphasizes exactly what Jaylen is good at (writing, leadership, civic engagement). If he visits and likes the vibe, this could be the one.

**Estimated net cost:** $3,000-5,000/year | **4-year total:** $12,000-20,000

---

#### SAFETIES

These are schools where admission is very likely and the cost is manageable. Safeties are not consolation prizes. They're the floor, and a strong floor means you make every decision from a position of strength, not desperation.

---

**9. Georgia State University**
*Atlanta, GA | ~67% admit rate | ~28,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Georgia State is the most underrated university in the Southeast. It's the most diverse university in Georgia, it's in the heart of downtown Atlanta, and for your financial situation, it's nearly free.

**The math:**

| Scenario | Tuition | Room/Board | Fees | HOPE | Pell | Need-Based | **Net Cost** |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| On campus, HOPE + Pell | $9,000 | $14,000 | $2,000 | -$9,000 | -$2,500 | -$3,000 | **~$10,500/yr** |
| Commuter, HOPE + Pell | $9,000 | $0 | $2,000 | -$9,000 | -$2,500 | -$1,000 | **~free or near-free** |

If Jaylen commutes from home, Georgia State could cost your family almost nothing beyond books and transportation. Even living on campus, it's well under your cap.

**Academic fit:** GSU's English and Communications programs are solid. The Honors College adds rigor and a smaller community. The journalism program benefits from Atlanta's media market. And dual enrollment credits from high school would give him a head start.

**Cultural fit:** Georgia State is one of the most diverse universities in the country. The student body is majority-minority. Jaylen would not be an outsider here. The downtown campus is urban in the truest sense, surrounded by the city he grew up in.

**The honest truth:** Georgia State doesn't have the prestige of an Emory or the cultural cachet of a Morehouse. But it's a school that has invested heavily in student success for exactly the kind of student Jaylen is: smart, motivated, from a family that can't afford to waste money. Their graduation rates for Black students have improved dramatically. The Honors College is a legitimately good experience.

If this ends up being the school, hold your head high. A Georgia State degree with no debt, combined with Jaylen's writing talent and debate skills, puts him in a stronger position at 22 than a Morehouse degree with $80,000 in loans.

**Estimated net cost:** $0-10,500/year (depending on commuter vs. residential) | **4-year total:** $0-42,000

**Financial risk: ESSENTIALLY ZERO.**

---

**10. Clark Atlanta University**
*Atlanta, GA | ~56% admit rate | ~3,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Clark Atlanta is an HBCU, it's in Atlanta, and it's part of the Atlanta University Center consortium (alongside Morehouse and Spelman). Students can cross-register at Morehouse and Spelman, use shared libraries and facilities, and participate in AUC-wide organizations. It's a way to get the HBCU experience and the AUC community at a school with higher admission rates and (sometimes) better aid than Morehouse.

**Academic fit:** English, Mass Media Arts, and Political Science are the strongest humanities programs. The AUC cross-registration means Jaylen could take a course at Morehouse without being enrolled there. The Robert W. Woodruff Library (shared across the AUC) is an excellent resource.

**Cultural fit:** Like Morehouse and Howard, the HBCU environment is a cultural fit. Clark Atlanta is smaller and more intimate than GSU or UGA. The AUC homecoming, the traditions, the community. It's a different experience than a PWI, and for some students, it's the right one.

**The honest truth:** Clark Atlanta's financial aid is inconsistent. Some students get strong packages; others face gaps. At your income, without merit, the net cost could be $14,000-20,000/year, which is at or above your cap. With merit, it could come down to $8,000-14,000.

Also, and I'll be direct: if Jaylen gets into Morehouse with comparable aid, there's little reason to choose Clark Atlanta over Morehouse. Clark Atlanta is on this list as a second HBCU option in Atlanta, and because the AUC cross-registration means he can access Morehouse's resources without being admitted there.

**Estimated net cost:** $8,000-20,000/year (depends on merit) | **4-year total:** $32,000-80,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Better than Howard, similar to Morehouse. Apply and evaluate the package.

## School List Summary

| # | School | Tier | Admit Rate | QuestBridge | Meets Full Need | Est. Net Cost/Year | Financial Risk |
|---|--------|------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Vanderbilt | Reach | ~5% | Yes | Yes (no loans) | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| 2 | Emory | Reach | ~11% | Yes | Yes (no loans <$75K) | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| 3 | Howard | Reach | ~30% | No | No | $8,000-22,000 | HIGH |
| 4 | Davidson | Target | ~17% | Yes | Yes (no loans) | $2,000-4,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| 5 | Morehouse | Target | ~48% | No | No | $8,000-20,000 | Moderate-High |
| 6 | UGA Honors | Target | ~42% | No | N/A (HOPE/Zell) | $5,000-11,500 | Very Low |
| 7 | Denison | Target | ~31% | Yes | Yes (most students) | $3,000-5,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| 8 | U of Richmond | Target | ~24% | No | Yes | $3,000-5,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| 9 | Georgia State | Safety | ~67% | No | N/A (HOPE/Pell) | $0-10,500 | Essentially Zero |
| 10 | Clark Atlanta | Safety | ~56% | No | No | $8,000-20,000 | Moderate |

**The pattern you should see:** The QuestBridge/full-need schools (Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, Richmond) are actually cheaper than the HBCUs (Howard, Morehouse, Clark Atlanta) if Jaylen is admitted. The HBCUs are culturally richer but financially riskier. UGA and Georgia State are the rock-solid financial floor. Your job in April of senior year is to compare the actual aid packages and make the best decision for your family with real numbers, not sticker prices.

**Maya, one more thing about this list.** You mentioned Emory and said, "I honestly don't know if we could afford it." You can. At your income, Emory would likely cost you less per year than Morehouse. The same is true for Vanderbilt, Davidson, and Richmond. I know that feels backwards. The reason is simple: these schools have massive endowments and they use them to cover the full cost for families like yours. The schools that can't afford to give you a full ride are often the ones with the lowest sticker prices but the biggest gaps.

This is the information asymmetry that Scaffold exists to close. The $300K family in Bethesda already knows this. Now you do too.

## FAFSA and CSS Profile Strategy

This section matters as much as the essays. One wrong move on financial aid forms can cost you thousands of dollars.

**FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid)**

- **Who requires it:** Every school on the list
- **When to file:** October 1 of senior year (October 1, 2029). File within the first two weeks. Earlier filing = earlier processing = earlier award letters.
- **Which tax year:** The FAFSA uses prior-prior year taxes. For the 2030-2031 academic year, that's your 2028 tax return.
- **Who files:** Maya, as the custodial parent. Marcus does not file the FAFSA. Under the FAFSA Simplification Act, only the parent who provides the greater share of financial support reports income. That's you.
- **Household size:** 3 (you, Jaylen, Amara)
- **Number in college:** 1 (Jaylen). Amara will not be in college yet.
- **Expected SAI (Student Aid Index):** At $72,000 income, household of 3, with one in college, limited assets, your SAI will be in the range of $5,000-8,000. This makes Jaylen eligible for a partial Pell Grant (estimated $2,000-3,000) and significant need-based aid at most schools.
- **Important:** The FAFSA now pulls tax information directly from the IRS through the FUTURE Act data-sharing process. This simplifies filing but means you need to have your taxes filed and processed before October 1.

**CSS Profile (College Scholarship Service Profile)**

- **Who requires it:** Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, University of Richmond. (Howard, Morehouse, UGA, Georgia State, and Clark Atlanta are FAFSA-only.)
- **When to file:** Check each school's deadline. Generally, November 1 for Early Action schools, January 1-15 for Regular Decision.
- **Key difference from FAFSA:** The CSS Profile is more detailed. It asks about home equity, retirement assets, and other financial details the FAFSA ignores. It also requires information about the non-custodial parent at some schools.

**The Non-Custodial Parent Question (READ THIS CAREFULLY):**

Some CSS Profile schools require the Non-Custodial Profile, a separate form filled out by Marcus. This can be a problem if:
- Marcus is unresponsive or uncooperative
- His financial information is hard to obtain
- His income, combined with yours, makes the family look wealthier than your actual situation

**Here's what to do:**
1. Check which schools on the CSS Profile list require the Non-Custodial Profile. Davidson historically requires it. Emory, Vanderbilt, Denison, and Richmond have varying policies (some waive it under certain circumstances).
2. For schools that require it: contact the financial aid office directly (by phone, not email) and explain the custody situation. You have sole legal and physical custody. Marcus sees the kids 4-5 times per year and provides inconsistent child support. Many schools will grant a Non-Custodial Profile waiver in these circumstances, but you have to ask.
3. Do this EARLY. Like, September of senior year early. Don't wait until January and then discover that a school needs a form from Marcus that he won't fill out.

Maya, this is one of those moments where being proactive saves you. Call the financial aid offices. Explain your situation. Ask for the waiver. Be direct. "I have sole custody, the father is minimally involved, and his financial situation does not reflect my household's ability to pay for college." Financial aid officers hear this regularly. They have a process for it.

**Georgia-Specific: HOPE and Zell Miller**

These are state scholarships administered through the Georgia Student Finance Commission (GSFC).

- **HOPE:** Requires a 3.0+ GPA at the end of high school and maintained in college. Covers tuition at Georgia public institutions (UGA, Georgia State).
- **Zell Miller:** Requires a 3.7+ GPA AND a 1200+ SAT (or 26+ ACT). Covers full tuition and fees.
- **Application:** Through the FAFSA. No separate application needed for HOPE or Zell Miller. File the FAFSA, and GSFC will determine eligibility automatically.
- **Critical detail:** HOPE and Zell Miller have a GPA maintenance requirement in college. If Jaylen's college GPA drops below the threshold, he loses the scholarship. This is another reason to choose a school where he'll thrive academically, not just one that admits him.

## Simulation Results

*(Based on 10,000 simulations at the optimistic profile level)*

#### Admission Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one admission) | **99.8%** |
| P(at least one REACH admission) | **38.2%** |
| P(at least one TARGET or better) | **94.6%** |
| Median number of acceptances | **5** |
| Mean number of acceptances | **5.2** |

Maya, the bottom line: it is virtually certain that Jaylen will be admitted to at least one school on this list. The probability of being shut out entirely is less than 1%. That should let you sleep at night. The real question isn't whether he'll get in somewhere. It's where, and at what price.

#### Financial Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one school under $15K/year) | **92.4%** |
| Median best 4-year total cost | **$16,000** |
| 10th percentile (best case) | **$8,000** |
| 25th percentile | **$12,000** |
| 75th percentile | **$28,000** |
| 90th percentile (worst realistic case) | **$44,000** |

The median outcome is $16,000 total for four years of college. That's $4,000 per year. That's inside your budget. The 90th percentile (a worse-than-average outcome) is $44,000 total, or $11,000 per year, which is still under your $15K cap. Even in a bad scenario, you're likely OK.

The 8% of simulations where no school comes in under $15K/year are mostly scenarios where: (a) he doesn't get into any QuestBridge or full-need school, (b) the HBCUs don't offer enough merit, and (c) his GPA or SAT dips below the Zell Miller threshold. In those cases, UGA with HOPE and Georgia State with HOPE still keep the cost manageable (just above the $15K line in some configurations). The true financial disaster scenario is nearly nonexistent.

#### Per-School Results

| School | P(Admitted) | P(Admitted AND Under $15K/yr) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Vanderbilt | 10.0% | 10.0% |
| Emory | 16.0% | 16.0% |
| Howard | 55.0% | 21.3% |
| Davidson | 25.0% | 25.0% |
| Morehouse | 65.0% | 28.4% |
| UGA Honors (UGA admit) | 70.0% | 68.2% |
| Denison | 42.0% | 42.0% |
| U of Richmond | 34.0% | 34.0% |
| Georgia State | 85.0% | 82.1% |
| Clark Atlanta | 72.0% | 27.5% |

**The story this table tells:** The full-need schools (Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, Richmond) are affordable 100% of the time if Jaylen is admitted, because they meet his full need by definition. The HBCUs (Howard, Morehouse, Clark Atlanta) are affordable only 30-40% of the time they admit him, because they don't consistently meet full need and require merit scholarships to hit your budget. UGA and Georgia State are affordable the vast majority of the time because of HOPE/Zell Miller.

This is the core tension I flagged earlier: the schools that fit Jaylen culturally are the least reliable financially. The plan accounts for this by applying broadly and using the full-need schools as the financial anchors.

```

The most common outcome is 5 acceptances. Jaylen will likely have multiple offers to compare.

#### Chart 4: Sibling Budget Impact (Amara)

This chart models what's left of your $5,000/year budget for college after paying for Jaylen, and how that affects your ability to save for Amara.

```
Scenario                   Annual $ Left for Amara's Fund
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
QB Match (~$2K/yr)         +$3,000/yr  → $12,000 saved by Amara's freshman year
Full-Need Met (~$3.5K/yr)  +$1,500/yr  → $6,000 saved
UGA + Zell (~$5K/yr)       $0/yr       → $0 saved (budget fully used)
UGA + HOPE (~$7.5K/yr)     -$2,500/yr  → Need $10K from other sources
HBCU No Merit (~$18K/yr)   -$13,000/yr → UNSUSTAINABLE without loans
```

Maya, this chart is the reason I keep coming back to cost. If Jaylen goes to a school that costs $3,000-4,000/year, you can start saving for Amara while he's in college. If he goes to a school that costs $18,000/year, you're taking on debt that will still be there when Amara applies in 2031-2032. Every dollar you save on Jaylen's education is a dollar you have for Amara's.

## Sensitivity Analysis: What If the Profile Lands Lower?

The numbers above assume the optimistic profile (3.75 GPA, 1340 SAT). Here's what changes at the realistic profile (3.55 GPA, 1230 SAT):

| Metric | Optimistic Profile | Realistic Profile | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| P(at least one reach) | 38.2% | 24.5% | -13.7 pts |
| P(at least one school ≤ $15K/yr) | 92.4% | 87.1% | -5.3 pts |
| Median best 4-year cost | $16,000 | $22,000 | +$6,000 |
| P(Zell Miller at UGA) | ~50% | ~25% | -25 pts |

Even at the lower profile, the probability of an affordable outcome is 87%. The financial floor (UGA with HOPE, Georgia State) holds in almost every scenario. The main thing you lose is access to the QuestBridge matches and the reach schools, which shifts the median cost upward.


---

## Decision Framework: April 2030

When the acceptances and financial aid packages arrive in March and April, you'll need to make a decision. Here are the five most likely scenarios, each with specific costs and a recommendation.

---

### Scenario A: QuestBridge Match at Vanderbilt, Emory, or Davidson

**Probability:** ~15-20% (combined across all QB partner schools)

**What it looks like:** In late November, Jaylen matches with one of these schools. Full four-year scholarship. Tuition, room, board, books, travel. Net cost: approximately $2,000-3,000/year (personal expenses, some fees).

**4-year total cost:** $8,000-12,000

**Recommendation:** Take it. Immediately. Do not second-guess it. Do not compare it against a Morehouse offer that hasn't arrived yet. A QuestBridge Match at any of these schools is the best possible financial outcome for your family. It frees up money for Amara, eliminates debt entirely, and places Jaylen at a school with the resources to support him for four years.

The QuestBridge Match is binding, so if he matches, the decision is made. This is the one binding commitment that makes sense for your family because the financial guarantee is locked in.

**What to do with the savings:** Start a 529 for Amara. Even $200/month for six years adds up.

---

### Scenario B: Admitted to a Full-Need School (Non-QB Route)

**Probability:** ~35-40% (at least one of Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, or Richmond through Regular Decision)

**What it looks like:** Jaylen didn't match through QuestBridge, but he's admitted to one or more of these schools through Regular Decision. The financial aid package covers everything except approximately $3,000-5,000/year (the Expected Family Contribution / Student Aid Index).

**4-year total cost:** $12,000-20,000

**Recommendation:** Compare the specific offers carefully. If multiple full-need schools admit him, the decision comes down to fit:
- Emory if he wants to stay in Atlanta and have access to home
- Vanderbilt if he wants a new city but still the South
- Davidson if he wants the small-college intellectual intensity
- Denison if the campus visit felt right and he connected with the community
- Richmond if the Leadership Studies program and guaranteed internship funding excite him

All of these are approximately the same cost. Choose on fit, not money.

**If he's also admitted to an HBCU with a strong package:** This is the hardest decision. A full-need PWI at $4,000/year vs. Morehouse at $12,000/year. The PWI is $32,000 cheaper over four years. Morehouse offers something money can't buy. Only Jaylen can make this call, and he should visit both campuses before deciding.

---

### Scenario C: Admitted to an HBCU with Strong Merit

**Probability:** ~25-30% (Morehouse or Howard with enough merit to come in under $15K/year)

**What it looks like:** Jaylen is admitted to Morehouse with a $12,000/year merit scholarship, bringing the net cost to $9,000-10,000/year. Or Howard with a similar package. The cost is under your cap but higher than the full-need PWIs.

**4-year total cost:** $36,000-56,000

**Recommendation:** If the cost is genuinely under $15,000/year and you're not taking on parent loans to cover the gap, this is a viable option. Morehouse or Howard at $10K/year is a real investment in an experience that the PWIs can't replicate.

But be honest about the numbers. If the "scholarship" covers tuition but room and board puts you at $18,000/year, that's $3,000 over your cap every year, or $12,000 over four years that has to come from somewhere. Don't rationalize it. Either the number works or it doesn't.

**Negotiation lever:** If Jaylen has a stronger offer from a full-need school (e.g., Emory at $3,000/year), share that offer with Morehouse's financial aid office and ask them to reconsider. HBCUs have limited funds but they also want strong students. It doesn't always work, but it costs nothing to ask.

---

### Scenario D: UGA Honors with HOPE or Zell Miller, No Affordable Alternatives

**Probability:** ~20-25%

**What it looks like:** The reach schools didn't pan out. The HBCUs came in over budget. But UGA admitted Jaylen to the Honors program, and with HOPE (or Zell Miller, if he hits the thresholds), the cost is $5,000-8,000/year.

**4-year total cost:** $20,000-32,000

**Recommendation:** Take it and feel good about it. This is not a consolation prize. UGA Honors is a selective program within a top-20 public university. Athens is a great college town with a vibrant culture. The English department is strong. Grady College of Journalism is one of the best in the country. The HOPE/Zell Miller scholarships make this one of the best dollar-for-dollar values in American higher education.

Jaylen can thrive here. He'll have to be more intentional about finding his community (it's a large, majority-white campus), but the Honors program provides a smaller cohort, the Black Affairs Council is active, and Atlanta is a 90-minute drive for when he needs to come home and cook on Sundays.

**The Zell Miller question:** If Jaylen has a 3.7+ GPA but falls short of 1200 on the SAT, he gets HOPE but not Zell Miller. The difference is roughly $2,500/year (about $10,000 over four years). This is why SAT prep in junior year matters. A 1200 SAT is achievable for Jaylen with focused math preparation, and it's worth an extra $10,000.

---

### Scenario E: Georgia State as the Primary Option

**Probability:** ~10-15%

**What it looks like:** The reaches, targets, and HBCUs either didn't admit him or came in way over budget. Georgia State with HOPE and the Honors program is the most affordable option, at $4,500/year (commuter) to $10,500/year (residential).

**4-year total cost:** $18,000-42,000 (depending on commuter vs. residential)

**Recommendation:** Georgia State is a legitimate university with real momentum, a diverse student body, and a downtown Atlanta location that connects Jaylen to internships, media, nonprofits, and the city he loves. The Honors College provides the smaller community and rigor that he needs.

The commuter option ($4,500/year) is tempting financially, but consider whether living on campus for at least the first year would benefit Jaylen socially and academically. The college experience matters, and living at home at 18 is different from living on your own. If the budget allows, one or two years on campus and then commuting for the last two is a reasonable compromise.

**This scenario is not failure.** A Georgia State degree with zero debt, plus Jaylen's writing ability, debate skills, and work ethic, puts him in a position to pursue graduate school, journalism, law, teaching, or policy work without financial burden. The name on the diploma matters less than most people think. The debt attached to it matters more.

---

### Scenario F: The Gap Year Option

**Probability of being the right call:** ~5% (only if no school comes in under $15K/year AND Jaylen didn't match through QuestBridge)

**What it looks like:** Every offer is over budget. The aid packages have gaps. The loans required are more than you're willing to take.

**Recommendation:** A gap year is not a defeat. Jaylen takes a year to work, save money, strengthen his application (retake the SAT, add to his portfolio, continue the literacy initiative), and reapply. Some schools (including most on this list) accept gap year students or allow admitted students to defer enrollment.

During the gap year:
- Work full-time and save
- Continue writing and submitting to contests
- Reapply to QuestBridge National College Match (you can apply more than once if you haven't enrolled)
- Apply to additional schools not on the original list
- Apply for the Gates Scholarship, Jack Kent Cooke, and Ron Brown again

This scenario is unlikely (the simulation puts it at well under 10%), but having a plan for it means you'll never feel desperate enough to take on $25,000/year in loans just because the calendar says May 1.

---

### Financial Aid Negotiation Guide

If a school's aid package has a gap, here's how to ask for more:

1. **Call, don't email.** Financial aid offices respond better to human conversations than form letters.
2. **Be specific.** "We received an offer from Emory that covers everything except $3,000/year. Morehouse's current package leaves a gap of $8,000/year. Is there anything you can do to close that gap?"
3. **Share competing offers.** Schools know they're competing. A specific dollar amount from a peer institution is the strongest leverage you have.
4. **Document changes.** If your financial situation has changed since you filed (job loss, medical bills, reduced child support), file a professional judgment appeal with documentation.
5. **Be polite but honest.** "We love Morehouse and Jaylen wants to attend, but we cannot afford a gap of $8,000/year. If the package can't come down, we'll need to accept another offer." This is not a threat. It's the truth.
6. **Know when to walk away.** If a school can't meet your budget after negotiation, accept the school that can. Loyalty to a brand is not worth $32,000 in parent loans.

---

### The Bottom Line

Maya, here's what the math says:

There is a **92% chance** that Jaylen will have at least one college option that costs your family $15,000/year or less. The median total cost for four years of college is approximately **$16,000**. That's $4,000/year. That's inside your budget with room to save for Amara.

The path to that outcome runs through three strategies, in order of impact:

1. **QuestBridge.** Apply to College Prep Scholars in junior year. Apply to the National College Match in senior year. Rank Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, and Denison. If he matches, the process is over and the cost is minimal.

2. **Protect the GPA and close the math gap.** A 3.7+ GPA keeps Zell Miller alive. A 1200+ SAT locks it in. These two numbers are worth $10,000+ over four years at UGA alone, and they make Jaylen competitive for merit at the HBCUs.

3. **Apply broadly to full-need schools.** Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, and Richmond all cost approximately the same at your income level ($3,000-5,000/year). The more of these he applies to, the higher the probability that at least one says yes.

The financial floor is real. UGA with HOPE, Georgia State with HOPE, these outcomes are available in nearly every simulation. Jaylen will go to college. He will graduate. And if you follow this plan, he'll do it without the kind of debt that would shadow the next twenty years of his life.

You told me you're terrified of making a mistake that costs him an opportunity. You're not making a mistake. You're making a plan. That's the opposite of a mistake.

Jaylen has a voice. The plan gives him the best chance of being heard.

---

## What to Do Now

Maya, here's what matters in the next six months. Everything else can wait.

1. **Get Jaylen a math tutor this summer.** Twice a week, six weeks minimum. Khan Academy is free. A local tutor through church or APS runs $0-500. This is the single highest-leverage move for his test scores and GPA trajectory.

2. **Make sure he's registered for Honors English and AP Human Geography at North Atlanta.** If the school tries to put him in standard English, push back. His 88th percentile reading score and MLK contest placement justify Honors. Call the counselor before August.

3. **Get him connected to the Atlanta Urban Debate League (AUDL) and North Atlanta's debate team before the first day of school.** If there's a summer workshop or pre-season meeting, he should be there. Debate is the extracurricular anchor of this entire plan.

4. **Bookmark QuestBridge.** You don't need to do anything about it yet, but know the name and know the timeline: College Prep Scholars application in spring of 11th grade, National College Match in fall of 12th grade. We'll come back to this.

5. **Read the Developmental Roadmap in the Reference Sections below.** It has the grade-by-grade course tables, extracurricular plans, and summer strategies. You don't need to memorize it. Just know it's there when you need it.

## Developmental Roadmap

### Where Jaylen Is Right Now (Spring 2026)

Before we map the future, let's be clear about the present.

**Strengths:**
- 3.7 GPA unweighted at a competitive APS magnet (Barack Obama Academy of Young Men)
- 88th percentile in reading (MAP), which is strong
- Honor roll every semester since 6th grade, showing consistency
- MLK Writing Contest, 2nd place (city-wide), which is a real, verifiable accomplishment
- APS Scholars nomination, which signals that teachers see something
- Debate (brand new, but already passionate)
- A mature, thoughtful kid who reads James Baldwin at 14

**Gaps to address:**
- 71st percentile in math (MAP). Not terrible, but this is the number that will drag down his SAT/ACT composite if we don't intervene.
- Not in accelerated math. This means his high school math sequence starts a year behind the most competitive applicants.
- No formal writing portfolio or competition record yet (the MLK contest is a start, not a body of work)
- Debate experience is less than one year. He'll need to build a tournament record quickly.
- No gifted identification (this doesn't matter for college, but it may have limited his access to advanced coursework in middle school)

**Things that aren't gaps but might feel like them:**
- Rec league basketball, not travel. That's fine. Unless he's getting recruited (he's not), basketball is a hobby, not a strategy. Keep playing for fun. Don't invest time and money trying to make it a college hook.
- No 529 plan. At your income level with your financial profile, need-based aid and merit scholarships will do more than a 529 ever could have. Don't beat yourself up about this.

---

### Summer Before 9th Grade (Summer 2026)

This summer is a transition. Jaylen is moving from a small magnet middle school to North Atlanta High School, which is a large, diverse APS school with strong AP offerings and an IB programme. The goal this summer is to prepare, not to pad a resume.

**Academics:**
- **Math intervention.** This is the single most important thing you do this summer. Get Jaylen a math tutor, even if it's just twice a week for six weeks. Not because he's failing, but because starting 9th grade confident in math versus anxious about math will affect his GPA, his course trajectory, and eventually his test scores. Look into Atlanta Public Schools' free summer tutoring, the Khan Academy SAT prep math modules (free, self-paced), or a local tutor through Ebenezer's network. Budget: $0-$500 depending on the route.
- **Reading list.** He already reads, so this isn't homework. But steer him toward a few books that connect to what he'll study in high school and that feed his interests: *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* (connects to his history interests), *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates (connects to his writing style and his neighborhood), *Stamped from the Beginning* by Ibram X. Kendi (the YA version is fine). These aren't random. They'll show up in his essays and conversations for years.

**Extracurriculars:**
- **Debate prep.** If North Atlanta's debate team has a summer camp or pre-season meeting, he should be there. If not, look into the Atlanta Urban Debate League (AUDL) summer workshops. AUDL is free and specifically supports APS students. This is where he'll meet his debate community.
- **Book drive planning.** Last year he collected 400 books. This year, set a bigger goal. But more importantly, add structure: recruit two or three friends to help, partner with another church or community organization, and document it (photos, numbers, a short write-up). This is the beginning of turning a one-time project into a sustained initiative.

**Logistics:**
- **Visit North Atlanta.** If there's an orientation or open house, go. Walk the building. Find the debate room. Meet the coach if possible. Jaylen is the kind of kid who does better when he knows the terrain.
- **Course registration.** Make sure he's registered for the right classes (see 9th grade section below). If they try to put him in standard English instead of Honors, push back. His 88th percentile reading score and his writing record justify Honors placement. Advocate for him.

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't sign him up for three summer enrichment programs. He needs a break. He needs to cook with you on Sundays, play basketball with his friends, and read on the couch. A rested kid performs better in September than an exhausted one.
- Don't tell him about this plan. You mentioned he doesn't know you're doing this. Keep it that way for now. At 14, the college conversation should be light and curious ("what kinds of schools sound interesting to you?"), not strategic. He'll engage with the strategy when he's ready, probably around junior year.

---

### 9th Grade (2026-2027)

This is the reset year. Colleges see Jaylen's transcript starting now. Middle school GPA doesn't appear on the application. That 3.7 is a baseline to build from, not a ceiling to protect.

**Academics:**

The goal is a 3.7+ unweighted GPA with the most rigorous humanities schedule North Atlanta offers, and a solid (not necessarily accelerated) math and science track.

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| English 9 | Honors | Non-negotiable. His strongest subject, needs to be in the top track from day one. |
| AP Human Geography | AP | Most accessible AP for freshmen. Aligns with his interests in history, community, place. Good GPA boost if he earns an A. |
| Algebra I / Coordinate Algebra | Regular or Honors | Depends on placement. If he can get into Honors, great. If not, earn an A in regular and move up. |
| Biology | Honors if available | Standard science sequence. Honors shows rigor without being overwhelming. |
| Spanish I | Regular | Starting a new language. Four years of one language looks better than two years of two. Spanish is practical for Atlanta. |
| Elective: Speech & Debate or Creative Writing | Regular | If North Atlanta offers either, take it. If he has to choose, debate. He can write on his own time. |

**Key academic note on math:** If Jaylen is placed in Algebra I (Coordinate Algebra) in 9th grade, his sequence will be:
- 9th: Algebra I
- 10th: Geometry
- 11th: Algebra II / Advanced Algebra
- 12th: Pre-Calculus or AP Statistics

This means he won't reach Calculus in high school. That's OK. Many successful applicants to selective schools take AP Statistics instead of Calculus. AP Stats is actually a better fit for Jaylen: it's more verbal and interpretive, involves reading data and making arguments, and rewards the kind of thinking he already does naturally. The key is getting strong grades in whatever math he takes.

**Extracurriculars:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Debate Team (North Atlanta + AUDL) | 10-12 | This is the main commitment. Join day one, attend every practice, compete in every tournament possible. Lincoln-Douglas (LD) debate is the best fit for his personality: it's one-on-one, values-based, and rewards deep reading and articulate argumentation. |
| Book Drive (Year 2) | 2-3 | Expand from last year. Set a goal of 600+ books. Partner with a second location or organization. Start documenting impact. |
| Youth Ministry (Ebenezer Baptist) | 3-4 | Continue. Take on more responsibility when offered. |
| Creative Writing (personal) | 3-5 | He's already doing this. Don't formalize it yet. Let him keep his journal. The structure comes later (literary magazine, competitions) when he's ready. |
| Basketball (rec league) | 4-6 | Keep playing. It's good for him physically and socially. Don't cut it for more "productive" activities. |

**Community Involvement:**
- Continue youth ministry service projects
- Book drive is the signature community activity
- Look into 100 Black Men of Atlanta's mentoring program (connects him with professional Black male role models, which matters given his family structure)

**Milestones:**
- First debate tournament (fall). Don't worry about winning. Focus on competing and learning.
- Published piece in North Atlanta's school literary magazine or newspaper (if they have one)
- End-of-year GPA: target 3.7+ unweighted
- PSAT 8/9 in the fall. This is a diagnostic, not a high-stakes test. It establishes a baseline for planning.

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't join ten clubs in September. Depth over breadth. Debate is the primary extracurricular. Writing is the secondary. Church is the community anchor. That's enough.
- Don't let anyone tell Jaylen that debate is "not a real extracurricular." It is one of the most respected activities in college admissions. Admissions officers at every school on his list know what NSDA is.
- Don't neglect math. A C+ in Algebra I will haunt him for four years. If he's struggling by October, get help immediately. Ask his teacher, use Khan Academy, find a peer tutor through APS Scholars, or ask at Ebenezer if anyone in the congregation tutors.
- Maya, don't compare his schedule to the kid down the street taking three APs as a freshman. That kid is either in a different academic situation or heading for burnout. Jaylen's schedule is right for Jaylen.

---

### 10th Grade (2027-2028)

Sophomore year is where the profile starts to take shape. The debate record is building. The writing portfolio begins. The GPA pattern is established.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| English 10 | Honors | Continue the top track. Start building the relationship with his English teacher (this person may write a rec letter). |
| AP World History | AP | Natural fit. His second AP, and the content aligns perfectly with his interests. This is where his intellectual curiosity shows on the transcript. |
| Geometry / Analytic Geometry | Honors if possible | Push for Honors if his Algebra I grade was a B+ or above. If it was a B or below, stay in regular and protect the GPA. |
| Chemistry | Honors if available | Standard sequence. Not his passion, but a solid grade here shows he can handle science. |
| Spanish II | Regular | Continue the sequence. |
| Elective: Journalism, Creative Writing, or African American Studies | Regular or Honors | If North Atlanta offers AP African American Studies (the new AP course), this is a strong choice. If not, journalism or creative writing supports the Voice thread. |

**Key academic decision: IB or AP?**

North Atlanta has a strong IB (International Baccalaureate) programme. You may be wondering if Jaylen should enter IB for 11th-12th grade. My recommendation: **stay on the AP track.** Here's why:

The IB Diploma requires strong performance across all subjects, including math and science. For a student whose strengths are clearly in humanities, the IB's requirement of Higher Level math or science could tank his GPA. The AP track lets him load up on humanities APs (where he'll earn 4s and 5s) and take regular or Honors math and science (where he'll earn solid Bs or better). Selective colleges understand both tracks and don't prefer one over the other.

If he wants the best of both worlds, some North Atlanta students take individual IB courses (like IB English) without pursuing the full Diploma. That's worth exploring with his counselor.

**Extracurriculars:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Debate (Varsity track) | 12-15 | By now he should be competing regularly in LD at GFCA (Georgia Forensic Coaches Association) tournaments. Target: qualifying for elimination rounds at a major tournament. Consider attending the Barkley Forum at Emory (prestigious HS debate tournament, right here in Atlanta). |
| Book Drive / Literacy Initiative (Year 3) | 3-4 | This year, level up. Give it a name. Build a simple website or social media page. Partner with the Pittsburgh branch of the Atlanta-Fulton County Library. Recruit younger volunteers. The arc from "one kid collecting books" to "a named community literacy initiative with volunteers and partners" is exactly the kind of growth admissions officers want to see. |
| Scholastic Art & Writing Awards | 2-3 (seasonal) | Submit for the first time. Categories: poetry, personal essay/memoir, or journalism. The Southeast regional affiliate accepts submissions in the fall (September-December, check exact dates). A Regional Gold Key or Silver Key is a nationally recognized honor. This is where the private journal becomes a public achievement. |
| Poetry Out Loud | 2-3 (seasonal) | A national poetry recitation competition run through the Georgia Council for the Arts. It's not original poetry, but it develops performance skills and connects to the Voice thread. School competitions happen in the fall, regionals in winter. |
| Youth Ministry (Ebenezer) | 3-4 | Take on a leadership role. Organize a project. Connect it to the literacy work if possible. |
| Basketball (rec league) | 4-6 | Still fine. If he wants to try out for the school JV team, he can. But this is a fun activity, not a strategic one. |

**New this year: Start thinking about summer after 10th grade.**

The summer between 10th and 11th grade is the most strategically important summer in the entire high school timeline. This is when competitive pre-college programs happen. Start researching now (applications open in January-March of 10th grade):

- **Georgia Governor's Honors Program (GHP):** Free. Four weeks. Highly selective. Jaylen should apply in the **Communicative Arts** category (creative writing, journalism, or speech). Being selected for GHP is one of the most respected honors in Georgia. Colleges throughout the Southeast know what it is. Application opens in January, nominations start at the school level.
- **Telluride Association Summer Seminar (TASS):** Free. Six weeks. Designed for students of color interested in critical thinking, social justice, and humanities. Held at universities across the country. Extremely competitive but Jaylen's profile is a strong fit. Application is in January-February.
- **Kenyon Review Young Writers Workshop:** Two weeks in Gambier, OH. Focused on creative writing. Tuition-based ($2,500+) but financial aid is available. Worth it if the money works.
- **Emory Pre-College Program:** Right here in Atlanta. Various course options including writing and humanities. Tuition-based but scholarships exist.

Maya, push for GHP and TASS first. They're free and they're the most prestigious. If those don't work out, look at Emory or Kenyon with financial aid.

**Milestones:**
- PSAT 10 (fall). Still diagnostic, but the scores start to inform SAT prep strategy.
- First Scholastic Art & Writing submission (fall/winter)
- First major debate tournament elimination round
- End-of-year GPA: target 3.7+ unweighted, 4.0+ weighted
- Summer program applications submitted (January-March)

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't let Jaylen coast because "it's only sophomore year." Sophomore year GPA is one of the three data points colleges weigh (along with junior year and test scores). A dip here is hard to recover from.
- Don't skip the Scholastic submission because "his writing isn't ready." It is. He placed 2nd in a city-wide contest in 8th grade. Submit and see what happens. The worst outcome is a rejection that teaches him what the judges are looking for.
- Don't overcommit to basketball at the expense of debate. If there's a schedule conflict between a debate tournament and a basketball game, debate wins. Every time.
- Don't start SAT prep yet. It's too early. 10th grade is about building the academic foundation. Test prep is a junior year activity.

---

### 11th Grade (2028-2029)

This is the year that matters most. Junior year GPA is the most heavily weighted year in admissions. SAT/ACT scores happen. AP exam scores happen. The college list takes shape. QuestBridge applications begin. Everything accelerates.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| AP English Language & Composition | AP | His best AP. This is where his writing, argumentation, and reading skills all converge. Target: a 5 on the exam. His AP Lang teacher becomes his most important recommender. |
| AP U.S. History | AP | The other natural AP. Aligns with his interests in American history, race, and social justice. Target: a 4 or 5. |
| Algebra II / Advanced Algebra | Honors if possible | Continue the math sequence. This is the hardest math year for most students. Get a tutor proactively, don't wait until he's struggling. |
| Physics or AP Environmental Science | Regular or AP | If he takes AP Environmental Science, that's a third AP with a reputation for being manageable. If he takes regular Physics, that protects his GPA. Either is fine. |
| Spanish III | Regular or Honors | Continue. If he's doing well, Honors shows rigor. |
| Elective: AP African American Studies, AP Government, or Dual Enrollment | AP or College | If he hasn't taken AP African American Studies yet, now. If he has, consider dual enrollment at Georgia State through APS's partnership. A college-level humanities course on his transcript is a strong signal. |

**That's 3-4 APs in junior year.** For Jaylen's profile, this is the right number. Some students take 5-6. Those students are usually at $40K/year private schools with no jobs and parents managing their schedules. Jaylen is at a public school, may have a part-time job, and has real extracurricular commitments. Three strong APs with high grades beats five APs with mixed results.

**SAT/ACT Prep:**

Start in the fall. Take the first official SAT or ACT in the spring (March SAT or April ACT).

Maya, this is where the math gap becomes a concrete problem. The SAT has two sections: Evidence-Based Reading & Writing (EBRW) and Math. Based on Jaylen's profile, here's my projection:

| Section | Optimistic | Realistic | Floor |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| EBRW | 720+ | 680 | 640 |
| Math | 620 | 570 | 530 |
| **Total** | **1340+** | **1250** | **1170** |

The reading/writing score will be strong. The math score is the variable. The difference between a 1250 and a 1350 composite is significant for merit scholarships and competitive admissions.

**How to close the math gap on the SAT:**
- Khan Academy SAT prep (free, personalized, linked to PSAT scores). Start September of junior year.
- If budget allows ($200-400), a targeted SAT math prep book like the College Panda SAT Math.
- Consider whether the ACT might be better for him. The ACT has four sections (English, Math, Reading, Science), and his English and Reading scores could be very high. The composite averages all four, so two strong sections can offset two weaker ones more effectively than the SAT's two-section structure. Have him take a practice test of both and compare.
- If your church or community has SAT prep resources, use them. Some APS schools also offer free prep through partnerships.

**Target scores for the school list:**
- 1300+ opens the door to merit scholarships at most target schools
- 1350+ makes him competitive at reach schools
- 1200+ keeps UGA Zell Miller in play (requires 1200 SAT or 26 ACT plus a 3.7 GPA)

**Extracurriculars:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Debate (Captain / Senior Leader) | 12-15 | By junior year, he should be competing at the state level (GFCA State Tournament) and ideally qualifying for NSDA Nationals or the Tournament of Champions. A leadership role (co-captain, team mentor) adds depth. |
| Literacy Initiative (Year 4) | 4-5 | The book drive has evolved into a named organization with partners, volunteers, and documented impact. Consider expanding: a little free library installation, a reading mentorship program for elementary students, a partnership with the Atlanta-Fulton County Library System. |
| Scholastic Art & Writing Awards (Year 2) | 3-4 (seasonal) | Second year submitting. Target: Regional Gold Key. If he earned a Silver Key last year, a Gold Key this year shows growth. A Gold Key advances to the national level. |
| QuestBridge College Prep Scholars | Application (one-time) | Apply in the spring (March deadline). This is the pipeline into QuestBridge National College Match in senior year. Being named a College Prep Scholar is an honor itself, and it gives him access to college fly-in programs, mentoring, and application support. More on QuestBridge in the Strategy Brief above. |
| GHP or Summer Program | Summer | If he was selected for GHP or TASS, he attends this summer. If not, look at other options (Emory Pre-College, local internships). A summer at the Atlanta History Center, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, or even a part-time job at a bookstore all have value. |
| Youth Ministry (Ebenezer) | 3-4 | Continue in a leadership role. |

**If Jaylen gets a part-time job this year, that's fine.** Don't cut it because it doesn't look as good as a summer program on a college application. Admissions officers at need-aware schools understand that some kids work because they need to. A job demonstrates responsibility, time management, and maturity. List it on the Common App.

**Milestones:**
- PSAT/NMSQT (October). This is the qualifying test for National Merit and National Achievement Scholars. A strong score here could open scholarship doors, though the cutoff in Georgia for National Merit is typically around 1460+ (Selection Index), which may be a stretch given his math. The National Achievement program (for Black students) has been discontinued, but National Merit remains relevant.
- SAT or ACT, first attempt (spring)
- AP exams: AP English Language, AP US History, plus any others (May)
- QuestBridge College Prep Scholars application (March)
- GHP or summer program
- Begin college list research (spring)
- Visit 2-3 colleges if possible (Morehouse and Georgia State are free to visit and right in Atlanta; Howard if you can swing a DC trip)

**What Not to Do:**
- Maya, do not let Jaylen write his college essays yet. I know that sounds wrong, but junior year is too early for final essays and too early for the pressure. What he should do is keep writing in his journal, keep entering competitions, and keep developing his voice. The essays come senior summer and fall.
- Don't apply Early Decision to any school. ED is binding, and you need to compare financial aid packages. The only binding option that makes sense for your family is QuestBridge Match (which guarantees full funding). The QuestBridge section and Decision Framework in the Strategy Brief above explain this in detail.
- Don't skip the SAT/ACT because some schools are "test-optional." Test-optional means they'll still consider scores if you submit them. A 1300+ helps. A 1150 might hurt. Take the test, prep for it, and decide whether to submit after you see the score.
- Don't take on $2,000+ for an SAT prep course. The free resources (Khan Academy, library prep books, APS-provided prep) are 80% as effective as the expensive ones. The marginal benefit of a Kaplan or Princeton Review course is not worth it at your budget.

---

### 12th Grade (2029-2030)

Senior year is execution. The profile is built. The school list is set. The work now is writing essays, submitting applications, filing financial aid forms, and making decisions.

**Academics:**

| Course | Level | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| AP English Literature & Composition | AP | The capstone. His 4th year of Honors/AP English. This teacher may also write a rec letter or serve as a reference. |
| AP Government and Politics | AP | Connects to debate, policy, civic engagement. Strong alignment with his threads. |
| Pre-Calculus or AP Statistics | Honors or AP | If he's ready for AP Statistics, take it. AP Stats is a better strategic choice than Pre-Calc for his profile: it's more verbal, more interpretive, and an AP exam score of 3+ adds value. If he's not ready for AP, take Pre-Calc Honors and earn a strong grade. |
| Science Elective or Dual Enrollment | Any level | Whatever fits. The rigor is established. Don't add a challenging science course that could tank his GPA in the semester when colleges are making decisions. |
| Spanish IV or AP Spanish Language | Honors or AP | Four years of one language is a strong signal. If he can handle AP Spanish, great. If not, Honors Spanish IV is fine. |
| Elective | Any | Debate (if offered as a course), creative writing, independent study, or dual enrollment. |

**The senior year GPA matters.** Colleges see first-semester senior grades for Regular Decision applications. A significant dip (from a 3.7 to a 3.2) raises red flags. An upward trend (from a 3.7 to a 3.9) helps. Keep the grades up through January.

**Extracurriculars (Maintenance, Not Expansion):**
- Debate: final season, captain role, mentoring younger debaters
- Literacy initiative: final year, biggest impact, document everything for applications
- Scholastic Art & Writing: final submission
- Youth ministry: continue

This is not the year to start new activities. It's the year to go deep on existing ones and show the arc.

**Application Timeline:**

This is detailed in the Application Timeline in the Reference Sections below. The short version: QuestBridge Match in September-November, Early Action in November, Regular Decision in January, financial aid decisions in March-April, commit by May 1.

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't get senioritis. Colleges can (and do) rescind acceptances for tanking grades. A few Bs are fine. Ds and Fs are not.
- Don't apply to 20 schools. Ten well-chosen schools with tailored essays beats 20 schools with copy-pasted supplements. Every school on your list should be there for a specific reason (financial, academic, or cultural).
- Don't panic if early results are disappointing. Most results come in March and April for Regular Decision. The financial floor schools (UGA, Georgia State) are reliable. You will have good options.
- Maya, do not take out Parent PLUS loans to cover a gap at a dream school. You said it yourself: "I've seen what that does to people." Trust that instinct. If a school can't get the cost under your cap, it's not the right school for your family right now, no matter the name on the sweatshirt.

### High School Course Progression (Full View)

| | English | Social Studies | Math | Science | Language | Elective |
|---|---------|---------------|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **9th** | English 9 Honors | AP Human Geography | Algebra I | Biology Honors | Spanish I | Speech/Debate or Creative Writing |
| **10th** | English 10 Honors | AP World History | Geometry (Honors if ready) | Chemistry Honors | Spanish II | Journalism, Creative Writing, or AP African American Studies |
| **11th** | AP English Language | AP U.S. History | Algebra II / Advanced Algebra (Honors if ready) | AP Environmental Science or Physics | Spanish III | Dual Enrollment or AP Gov |
| **12th** | AP English Literature | AP Government | AP Statistics or Pre-Calculus Honors | Science Elective | Spanish IV or AP Spanish | Elective / Dual Enrollment |

**Total APs over four years: 6-8** (Human Geo, World History, English Lang, US History, English Lit, Government, possibly AP Stats, possibly AP African American Studies or AP Environmental Science)

This is a rigorous schedule that plays to his strengths. Colleges will see a student who challenged himself in the humanities and held his own in math and science. That's exactly the right message.

---

### The "Lands Lower" Version

Everything above is the optimistic plan. Here's what happens if things don't go perfectly.

**If the GPA comes in at 3.4-3.5 instead of 3.7+:**
- The reach schools (Vanderbilt, Emory) become longer shots
- UGA is still very achievable (average admitted GPA is around 4.0 weighted, but in-state students with strong profiles are regularly admitted in the 3.5-3.7 UW range)
- HOPE Scholarship (3.0+) is still locked. Zell Miller (3.7+) is at risk.
- Georgia State remains a strong safety with good aid
- HBCUs (Morehouse, Howard, Clark Atlanta) remain viable with strong essays and extracurriculars

**If the SAT comes in at 1150-1200 instead of 1300+:**
- Test-optional applications become the strategy for reach schools
- UGA Zell Miller requires a 1200 SAT, so this is on the bubble. An ACT of 26+ is the alternative path.
- Merit scholarships at some schools decrease
- Need-based aid (which is income-driven, not score-driven) is unaffected

**If debate doesn't produce state-level results:**
- That's OK. Participation and leadership in debate for four years is still a strong activity. Not every debater needs to be a national qualifier.
- The writing portfolio and community literacy work carry more weight anyway, because they're more distinctive

**If he doesn't get into any reach schools:**
- UGA Honors with HOPE/Zell Miller is a genuinely excellent outcome. Athens is a great college town. The Honors program is small and rigorous. And the cost is unbeatable.
- Georgia State Honors in downtown Atlanta, with the ability to live at home or on campus, is also a strong outcome at a fraction of the cost.
- This is not a consolation scenario. This is a good life.

## Projected Applicant Profile (Fall 2029)

Before we pick schools, we need to be honest about who Jaylen will be on paper when he applies. Not who he is as a person (you know that better than anyone), but how an admissions officer will read his file in the 12-15 minutes they spend on it.

**Optimistic Profile (everything goes well):**

| Component | Projection |
|-----------|-----------|
| GPA (UW / Weighted) | 3.75 / 4.1 |
| SAT | 1340 (EBRW 730, Math 610) |
| APs taken by senior fall | 6-7 (Human Geo, World History, English Lang, US History, English Lit, Government, possibly AP Stats or AP African American Studies) |
| AP Scores | 4s and 5s in humanities, 3+ in others |
| Class Rank | Top 15-20% at North Atlanta |
| Primary Activity | Debate (4 years, captain, state-level competitor) |
| Signature Project | Community literacy initiative (4 years, named org, documented impact) |
| Writing Distinction | Scholastic Art & Writing Regional Gold Key; published work |
| Leadership | Debate captain, youth ministry leader, literacy org founder |
| Special Programs | QuestBridge College Prep Scholar, GHP Communicative Arts |
| Demographic Factors | Black male, first-generation four-year college, single-parent household, urban public school |

**Realistic Profile (some things don't pan out):**

| Component | Projection |
|-----------|-----------|
| GPA (UW / Weighted) | 3.55 / 3.8 |
| SAT | 1230 (EBRW 680, Math 550) |
| APs taken | 5-6 |
| AP Scores | Mix of 3s, 4s, and 5s |

| Debate | 4 years, active competitor, some leadership, no state title |
| Literacy Project | Ongoing but less formalized |
| Writing | Scholastic Silver Key or Honorable Mention |
| QuestBridge | Applied but not named CPS |

**What admissions officers will see either way:**
- A Black male from a single-parent household in urban Atlanta who took the most rigorous humanities curriculum available at his public school
- A debater and a writer with a genuine community service record, not a resume-padding one
- A first-generation college student (for a four-year degree) with clear intellectual interests and a track record of initiative
- A kid whose math scores are lower than his verbal scores (this is common and understood; it doesn't disqualify him)

**What they won't see unless we tell them:**
- The journal. The poetry. The abandoned houses essay. The way he cooks with you on Sundays. The fact that he organized a 400-book drive because he wanted to, not because someone assigned it. This is what the essays and recommendation letters are for, and it's where Jaylen's application goes from "solid" to "memorable."

## Activities List (Common App Format)

The Common App allows 10 activities, listed in order of importance to the applicant. The order matters. Lead with what's most distinctive, not what took the most hours. These are projected for fall of senior year (2029) based on the roadmap above.

---

**Activity 1**
- **Type:** Community Service (Volunteer)
- **Position/Role:** Founder & Director
- **Organization:** [Name TBD] Literacy Initiative, Pittsburgh Neighborhood, Atlanta
- **Description (150 chars):** Founded neighborhood book drive at age 13; grew into multi-site literacy initiative collecting 2,000+ books and partnering with Atlanta-Fulton County Library, Ebenezer Baptist Church, and local schools. Launched reading mentorship program for elementary students.
- **Grade Levels:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 5
- **Weeks/Year:** 40

*Why this is #1: This is Jaylen's most distinctive activity. He started it on his own, grew it over five years, and it connects his love of reading to real community impact. No one else on the planet has this exact story.*

---

**Activity 2**
- **Type:** Debate/Speech
- **Position/Role:** Team Captain
- **Organization:** North Atlanta High School Debate Team / Atlanta Urban Debate League
- **Description (150 chars):** Competed in Lincoln-Douglas debate for four years; served as team captain senior year. Competed at GFCA State Tournament and NSDA qualifying tournaments. Mentored novice debaters through AUDL partnership.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 12
- **Weeks/Year:** 40

*Why this is #2: Debate is his primary in-school extracurricular and the activity where he's invested the most competitive hours. Captain + state-level competition is a strong credential.*

---

**Activity 3**
- **Type:** Art (Writing)
- **Position/Role:** Writer
- **Organization:** Independent / Scholastic Art & Writing Awards
- **Description (150 chars):** Maintained personal writing practice (poetry, essays, cultural criticism) since 6th grade. Submitted annually to Scholastic Art & Writing Awards; received Regional Gold Key in Poetry. Published in school literary magazine.
- **Grade Levels:** 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 5
- **Weeks/Year:** 52

*Why this is #3: Seven years of sustained creative writing practice is extraordinary. The Scholastic recognition validates it externally. The "since 6th grade" detail signals that this is who he is, not what he does for college.*

---

**Activity 4**
- **Type:** Religious
- **Position/Role:** Youth Ministry Leader
- **Organization:** Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta
- **Description (150 chars):** Active in youth ministry since age 10. Led community service projects including food drives, neighborhood cleanups, and holiday programs for families. Organized and led youth-led Sunday service twice annually.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12 (participated since 5th grade but Common App focuses on HS)
- **Hours/Week:** 4
- **Weeks/Year:** 48

*Why this is #4: Eight years at Ebenezer Baptist. This shows character, consistency, and values. For schools that care about community (and all of them say they do), this is powerful.*

---

**Activity 5**
- **Type:** Academic
- **Position/Role:** Scholar
- **Organization:** APS Scholars Program, Atlanta Public Schools
- **Description (150 chars):** Selected for district-wide academic enrichment program providing advanced coursework, college preparation workshops, mentoring, and leadership development. Participated in community-based research projects.
- **Grade Levels:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 3
- **Weeks/Year:** 36

---

**Activity 6**
- **Type:** Journalism/Publication
- **Position/Role:** Editor or Staff Writer

- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 4
- **Weeks/Year:** 32

---

**Activity 7**
- **Type:** Academic / Summer Program
- **Position/Role:** Participant
- **Organization:** Georgia Governor's Honors Program (Communicative Arts) *[or substitute: TASS, Emory Pre-College, or other]*
- **Description (150 chars):** Selected for competitive, state-funded four-week residential summer program in communicative arts. Studied creative writing and rhetoric with peers from across Georgia. Produced capstone portfolio.
- **Grade Levels:** 11
- **Hours/Week:** 40
- **Weeks/Year:** 4

*Note: If Jaylen is selected for GHP, it goes here. If not, substitute whichever summer program he attends. If he works a summer job instead, list that, it's equally valid.*

---

**Activity 8**
- **Type:** Community Service (Volunteer)
- **Position/Role:** Reading Tutor
- **Organization:** Pittsburgh Neighborhood Branch, Atlanta-Fulton County Library / Ebenezer Baptist Church
- **Description (150 chars):** Provided weekly one-on-one reading tutoring to elementary students in the Pittsburgh neighborhood. Matched with 3-4 students per year through library and church referrals.
- **Grade Levels:** 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 3
- **Weeks/Year:** 36

*This connects to the literacy initiative (#1) but is a separate, personal activity: direct one-on-one mentoring rather than organizational leadership.*

---

**Activity 9**
- **Type:** Athletics (Club)
- **Position/Role:** Player
- **Organization:** Atlanta Parks & Recreation Basketball League
- **Description (150 chars):** Played in recreational basketball league since middle school. Team co-captain in 11th grade. Organized pickup games in the Pittsburgh neighborhood during summers.
- **Grade Levels:** 9, 10, 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 5
- **Weeks/Year:** 20

*Basketball isn't a strategic activity for college, but it shows a well-rounded kid who isn't just studying and debating. Admissions officers like seeing a real person.*

---

**Activity 10**
- **Type:** Work (Paid)
- **Position/Role:** *[TBD, projected]*
- **Organization:** *[TBD, part-time job starting junior or senior year]*
- **Description (150 chars):** Part-time employment during school year and/or summers. *[Specifics will depend on the job: retail, food service, office work, etc.]*
- **Grade Levels:** 11, 12
- **Hours/Week:** 10-15
- **Weeks/Year:** 40

*Maya, if Jaylen gets a job, list it. Do not remove it to make room for something "more impressive." At need-aware and need-blind schools, a working student from a single-parent household signals maturity, responsibility, and context. Admissions officers at every school on this list understand that some kids work because they have to.*

## Honors and Awards

Listed in order of prestige/distinctiveness. Projected year noted. Items marked [ASPIRATIONAL] require things to go well; items marked [LIKELY] are achievable with consistent effort; items marked [ACHIEVED] are already done.

1. **Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, Regional Gold Key (Poetry or Personal Essay/Memoir)** — Projected: 11th grade [ASPIRATIONAL]. A Regional Gold Key advances to national judging and is recognized by every selective college in the country.

2. **QuestBridge College Prep Scholar** — Projected: 11th grade [LIKELY given financial profile]. National recognition that signals both academic achievement and financial context. Opens doors to college fly-in programs and the National College Match.

3. **Georgia Governor's Honors Program, Communicative Arts** — Projected: summer after 10th or 11th grade [ASPIRATIONAL]. One of the most respected honors in the state of Georgia. Free, four-week residential program. Selection is competitive.

4. **NSDA National Qualifier or GFCA State Tournament Finalist (Lincoln-Douglas Debate)** — Projected: 11th-12th grade [ASPIRATIONAL]. Qualifying for the NSDA National Tournament is a significant debate achievement. A state finalist placing (top 4-8) at GFCA is strong.

5. **Atlanta Urban Debate League Tournament Champion or Finalist** — Projected: 10th-12th grade [LIKELY if debate trajectory continues]. AUDL tournaments are a stepping stone to broader competition and demonstrate sustained debate involvement.

6. **MLK Jr. Writing Contest, 2nd Place (City-Wide, Atlanta)** — 8th grade [ACHIEVED]. Already in the bank. A concrete, verifiable writing accomplishment.

7. **AP Scholar with Distinction** — Projected: 12th grade [LIKELY with 4+ APs scored 3.5+ average]. Requires scores of 3+ on five or more AP exams with a 3.5+ average. Achievable with his projected AP load.

8. **National Honor Society** — Projected: 10th or 11th grade [LIKELY with 3.5+ GPA]. Standard but expected. Absence would be noticed more than presence is celebrated.

9. **Honor Roll, Every Semester (6th-12th Grade)** — Ongoing [ACHIEVED/LIKELY]. Seven years of consecutive honor roll is a consistency signal.

10. **Scholastic Art & Writing Awards, Regional Silver Key or Honorable Mention** — Projected: 10th grade (first submission) [LIKELY]. Even if the Gold Key doesn't happen, a Silver Key or Honorable Mention in the first year of competition is a strong result.

## Essay Strategy

The college essay is where Jaylen's application goes from competitive to unforgettable. This kid has a writing voice that most 17-year-olds don't. The goal is to let that voice come through, not to package it into what he thinks admissions officers want to hear.

#### Common App Personal Essay

**The Angle: The Abandoned Houses**

You told me about an essay Jaylen wrote about walking past the abandoned houses on your block and imagining who used to live there. You said it made you cry. That's the essay.

Not a polished, cleaned-up, thesis-driven version. The real thing. A personal essay about seeing, about paying attention, about what it means to grow up in a neighborhood that carries visible history. About being the kind of kid who walks past something every day and one day stops to actually look at it and think about it.

This essay does several things at once without trying:
- It reveals his writing voice (which is his greatest asset)
- It grounds him in a specific place (Pittsburgh, Atlanta, the neighborhood he comes from)
- It demonstrates the "thinks in questions, not answers" quality that Ms. Coleman described
- It avoids every cliche in the first-gen/low-income/Black male essay playbook

**What the essay should NOT be:**
- A "growing up without a dad" narrative. His family structure may come up naturally, but it should not be the thesis. Admissions officers read hundreds of absent-father essays. Jaylen is more interesting than that.
- A "my neighborhood is tough but I rose above it" story. Poverty tourism. Avoid.
- A "debate changed my life" essay. It might be true, but it's generic. Thousands of debaters write this essay.
- An essay that sounds like Maya wrote it. Or like a college counselor coached it. His voice is his voice. Protect it.

**What it should feel like to read:** Like you're sitting on a porch with a kid who is smarter and more observant than he lets on, and he's telling you something he noticed, and by the end you're seeing the world slightly differently. That's the goal.

#### Supplemental Essay Angles (By School)

Each school asks its own supplemental questions ("Why us?", "What will you contribute?", etc.). The key is connecting Jaylen's specific story to each school's specific offerings. Below is a lead angle for each.

| School | Lead Angle | Specific Detail to Reference |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Vanderbilt | How the literacy initiative connects to Vanderbilt's emphasis on civic engagement and Nashville's own literacy challenges | The Peabody College community partnerships; Nashville Public Library system |
| Emory | What it means to attend a world-class university 20 minutes from the neighborhood where he organized a book drive. The tension between proximity and transformation. | The Center for Community Partnerships; James Weldon Johnson Institute; "Atlanta as classroom" |
| Howard | What Ms. Coleman's Morehouse comment meant to him. What it means to enter a tradition. The difference between reading James Baldwin alone and reading him surrounded by people who live that tradition. | Moorland-Spingarn Research Center; Howard's debate legacy; English department's creative writing focus |
| Davidson | The intellectual hunger, the "thinks in questions" quality. What happens when a kid from a neighborhood where curiosity isn't always rewarded enters a community where it's the currency. | The Humanities Program; small class sizes; writing across the curriculum; the Barkley Forum connection |
| Morehouse | Brotherhood. Male role models. The gap his uncle and pastor fill and the gap that remains. What it would mean to be surrounded by young Black men who write, think, argue, and lead. | Crown Forum; the Morehouse Mystique; the AUC community |
| UGA | The idea that staying in Georgia isn't playing it safe. Georgia is home, and home deserves his best thinking. UGA Honors as a place to go deep on Southern history and culture. | Grady College of Journalism; the Willson Center for Humanities; UGA's Special Collections (civil rights archives) |
| Denison | What a small community offers a kid who is quiet until he trusts you. The transition from being one voice in a large school to being a voice that shapes a small one. | Lisska Center; Denison's creative writing community; the Narrative Journalism course |
| U of Richmond | The Richmond Guarantee (funded internship/research). His community work in Atlanta and what he'd do with a summer of funded civic engagement in Richmond. Writing as a tool for understanding history and place. | Jepson School of Leadership Studies; Bonner Center for Civic Engagement; Richmond's racial history as a subject of study |
| Georgia State | Atlanta is his classroom and his subject. He's been writing about this city since he was 12. Georgia State puts him in the center of it. | Honors College; downtown Atlanta campus; GSU's Creative Writing program; connection to Atlanta's media and nonprofit sectors |
| Clark Atlanta | The AUC. Access to Morehouse and Spelman's intellectual communities. The legacy of Black intellectual life in Atlanta, which started at these institutions. | Robert W. Woodruff Library (AUC shared); cross-registration; Clark Atlanta's Mass Media Arts program |

**A note on "Why us?" essays:** Maya, the biggest mistake applicants make on supplemental essays is writing something generic that could apply to any school. "I love your diverse community and strong academics" is meaningless. Each essay above references a specific program, center, or resource at that school. Jaylen should visit each school's website, find the specific thing that connects to his interests, and write about it concretely. "I want to take Professor [Name]'s course on [Topic] because [specific reason]" is better than "your English department is renowned."

## Recommendation Letter Strategy

Jaylen needs two academic recommendation letters (required by most schools) and can benefit from one or two supplemental letters. The goal is for the letters to collectively show three things: his intellectual depth, his character, and his growth.

**Letter 1: AP English Language Teacher (11th Grade)**

This is the most important letter. This teacher will see Jaylen at his best, in his strongest subject, during his most critical academic year. Jaylen should build a genuine relationship with this teacher starting in September of junior year. Not a strategic, transactional one. A real one: participate in class, visit during office hours, share his writing beyond the assignments.

**What this letter should convey:** That Jaylen is not just a good student in English but a genuine thinker and writer. The teacher should have specific examples of his insight, his voice, and his growth. The ideal letter mentions a specific moment in class, a specific piece of writing, or a specific conversation that illustrates who he is intellectually.

**When to ask:** Late April or early May of junior year. Give the teacher the entire summer to write it. Provide a resume, a list of activities, and a short note about what Jaylen hopes the letter will convey.

**Letter 2: AP U.S. History Teacher (11th Grade)**

The second letter should come from a different discipline to show breadth. APUSH is the right choice because it connects to Jaylen's interests in history, race, and American society. This teacher will see him engage with content he cares about deeply.

**What this letter should convey:** Analytical thinking, intellectual curiosity, the ability to grapple with complex and uncomfortable historical material. If Jaylen writes a particularly strong paper or makes a memorable contribution to a class discussion about civil rights, reconstruction, or racial history, that's the moment the teacher should write about.

**When to ask:** Same timeline. Late April/early May of junior year.

**Supplemental Letter: Debate Coach**

Many schools accept an additional recommendation from a non-academic source. The debate coach is the right choice. This person has seen Jaylen compete under pressure, grow from a novice to a leader, and develop skills that don't show up on a transcript.

**What this letter should convey:** Jaylen's growth as a competitor and a thinker. His ability to argue both sides of an issue. His leadership of younger debaters. His composure (or his passion, either works) in competition. Specific tournament moments or coaching interactions.

**When to ask:** Beginning of senior year (September) is fine for the supplemental letter.

**Optional Supplemental: Pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church**

Some schools (especially those with holistic review processes) accept a community recommendation. If Jaylen's pastor has known him for years and can speak to his character, his service, and his growth as a young man, this letter adds a dimension that no teacher or coach can provide.

**What this letter should convey:** Character. The book drive. The youth ministry leadership. Who Jaylen is when no one is grading him.

**What about Ms. Coleman?** She's the teacher who compared him to Morehouse students and said he "thinks in questions, not answers." That's a powerful testimonial. However, she's a middle school teacher, and colleges primarily want high school recommendations. If a school accepts additional letters (some do), a short note from Ms. Coleman could be valuable, especially for Morehouse. But she should not replace either of the two primary academic recommenders.

---

---

## Writing Portfolio Guidance

Jaylen's writing is his most distinctive asset. Several schools on this list accept or encourage supplemental writing samples, arts supplements, or creative portfolios. He should prepare one.

**What to include (by senior fall):**
- 3-5 of his strongest pieces, selected for range and quality
- At least one poem, one personal essay, and one analytical or argumentative piece
- The Tulsa Race Massacre essay (revised and polished) is a strong inclusion
- One or two of the strongest poems from his journal (he'll need to choose, and yes, he'll need to let someone read them)
- A piece from Scholastic submissions, especially if it received a Key or Honorable Mention

**How to use it:**
- **Emory, Davidson, Denison, Richmond:** These schools accept arts supplements or additional materials through the Common App or their own portals. Submit the portfolio as a writing supplement.
- **Howard, Morehouse:** May not have a formal supplement process, but the creative writing samples can be referenced in the application essays or sent directly to the English department with an expression of interest.
- **Vanderbilt:** Accepts arts supplements. A writing portfolio submitted here signals serious intent.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't submit unrevised journal entries. The raw voice is good, but the portfolio should show craft as well as voice. Revise with a trusted reader (English teacher, writing workshop mentor, Scholastic feedback).
- Don't submit more than five pieces. Quality over volume. An admissions officer will read two or three of them at most.
- Don't submit fiction (unless it's extraordinary) if his strengths are in poetry and personal essay. Lead with what he does best.

## Senior Year Application Timeline

This is the month-by-month playbook for 12th grade. Print it out. Put it on the refrigerator. Check things off as you go.

**August 2029:**
- Finalize Common App account (opens August 1)
- Complete the Common App personal essay (should be drafted over the summer, now it gets final polish)
- Request recommendation letters if not already done (teachers, debate coach)
- Complete the Activities and Honors sections of the Common App
- Begin supplemental essays for QuestBridge and Early Action schools
- Create a CSS Profile account at cssprofile.collegeboard.org

**September 2029:**
- QuestBridge National College Match application opens (deadline: late September, typically Sept 26)
- Finalize the school list (confirm all 10 schools, verify deadlines and requirements)
- SAT/ACT retake if the spring score needs improvement
- Begin drafting supplemental essays for all schools (even if you won't submit until January, start now)
- Schedule campus visits if possible (Morehouse and Georgia State are local and free; Howard if you can get to DC)

**October 2029:**
- **FAFSA opens October 1. File immediately.** Do not wait.
- Submit CSS Profile for schools with November 1 EA deadlines
- QuestBridge Match rankings due (late October, typically Oct 24). Jaylen ranks his preferred schools in order. If he matches, it's binding with a full scholarship.
- UGA Early Action deadline: check exact date (historically mid-October or early November)
- Contact CSS Profile schools about Non-Custodial Profile waivers if not already done
- PSAT/NMSQT (if taking it again, though results from junior year are what count for National Merit)

**November 2029:**
- **Early Action deadlines:**
  - Emory EA: November 1 (if not applying through QuestBridge Match)
  - Davidson ED I: November 15 (but DO NOT apply ED unless it's through QuestBridge, because ED is binding and you need to compare aid packages)
  - Morehouse Priority: November 1
  - UGA EA: check date
- QuestBridge Match Day results: late November or early December. If he matches, celebrate. The process is over for that school. If he doesn't match, his application rolls to Regular Decision at those schools automatically.
- Continue writing RD supplemental essays

**December 2029:**
- EA results begin arriving (Emory, UGA, Morehouse priority if applicable)
- If QuestBridge didn't match: finalize Regular Decision applications
- Finalize CSS Profile submissions for RD schools (if not already done)
- Review any Early Action financial aid offers that arrive with decisions
- Holiday break: breathe. Apply to external scholarships (see below).

**January 2030:**
- **Regular Decision deadlines:**
  - Howard: January 15 (or check current deadline)
  - Clark Atlanta: rolling, but submit by January for priority
  - Denison: January 15
  - University of Richmond: January 1 or January 15 (check current year)
  - Any remaining schools
- Apply to external scholarships: Jack Kent Cooke Foundation College Scholarship (November deadline, so this may need to happen earlier), Gates Scholarship (September deadline for senior year), local Atlanta community scholarships through the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, Ebenezer Baptist Church scholarships (if they offer any), APS district scholarships
- Verify that all FAFSA and CSS Profile submissions are complete and processing

**February 2030:**
- Continue external scholarship applications
- FAFSA corrections or updates if needed
- Wait. This is the hardest month. Most RD results don't come until March.
- Use this time to research each school's admitted student events, housing options, and orientation schedules so you're ready to act quickly in April

**March 2030:**
- RD results arrive throughout the month
- Financial aid packages arrive (sometimes with the decision, sometimes separately, sometimes later)
- If any packages are unclear, call the financial aid office and ask for a breakdown
- Begin comparing offers using a simple spreadsheet: school name, total cost of attendance, grants/scholarships, net cost to family, and whether the net cost is under $15,000/year
- If Jaylen is admitted to a school whose aid package leaves a gap, this is the time to appeal (see Decision Framework in Phase 2)

**April 2030:**
- **Decision month.** Compare all offers on cost, fit, and gut feeling.
- Attend admitted student events (Emory and Morehouse are local; others may offer travel stipends for admitted students, especially QuestBridge and full-need schools)
- If two schools are close on cost, visit both if possible
- Financial aid negotiation: if one school offers significantly more than another, you can share the competing offer and ask the more expensive school to reconsider. This works at schools that meet full need. It doesn't always work at schools that don't.
- Make a decision by May 1

**May 2030:**
- **National College Decision Day: May 1.** Submit enrollment deposit.
- Notify all other schools that Jaylen is declining their offers (this is courteous and opens waitlist spots for other students)
- Submit housing deposit and housing preferences
- Register for orientation
- Send final transcript when available
- Celebrate. You did it.

## External Scholarships Worth Pursuing

These are scholarships outside of institutional aid. They don't replace the school's financial aid but they can cover the remaining out-of-pocket cost.

| Scholarship | Amount | Deadline | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Gates Scholarship | Full cost of attendance (remaining need) | September of senior year | For Pell-eligible students. Extremely competitive but Jaylen's profile fits. |
| Jack Kent Cooke Foundation College Scholarship | Up to $55,000/year | November of senior year | For high-achieving students with financial need. Requires a strong application. |
| QuestBridge (already on the list) | Full four-year scholarship via Match | September-October | Covered above. |
| Coca-Cola Scholars Program | $20,000 | October of senior year | Atlanta-based, which helps. Focused on leadership and community service. |
| Elks Most Valuable Student | Up to $12,500/year | November of senior year | Based on academics, leadership, and financial need. |
| Ron Brown Scholar Program | $40,000 over four years | January of senior year | For academically talented, community-oriented Black students. Jaylen fits this perfectly. |
| Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta | Various ($1,000-10,000) | Varies | Multiple scholarships for Atlanta-area students. Check their website starting in fall of senior year. |
| APS District Scholarships | Various | Spring | Check with the North Atlanta guidance office. |
| Ebenezer Baptist Church (if applicable) | Various | Check locally | Many churches offer scholarships to members. Ask your pastor. |

Maya, scholarship applications take time. Don't apply to 50 of them. Choose 8-10 that fit Jaylen's profile and invest in quality applications. The Gates, Jack Kent Cooke, and Ron Brown are the big ones for his situation.

## Monte Carlo Simulation Parameters

The table below feeds directly into the financial simulation in Phase 2. Each number is an estimate based on published Common Data Set (CDS) admission rates, institutional financial aid policies, and adjustments for Jaylen's projected profile. These are not guarantees. They are the best-informed inputs I can produce. Where I'm guessing, I'll say so.

**How to read the adjustments:** Published admit rates are for all applicants. Jaylen's profile includes factors that move the needle in specific ways:
- **First-generation status:** Positive factor at all schools (moderate boost)
- **Black male:** Positive factor at most selective PWIs that are actively seeking demographic diversity (moderate to significant boost). Neutral at HBCUs where this is the majority demographic.
- **Single-parent, low-income household:** Positive factor at need-blind schools and QuestBridge partners (context factor). Neutral to slightly negative at need-aware schools that may consider ability to pay.
- **Urban public school (APS):** Neutral to slightly positive. Selective schools know APS and can contextualize his transcript.
- **QuestBridge applicant:** Significant positive factor at partner schools. QB applicants are reviewed with an understanding of their economic context.
- **Strong humanities, weaker math:** Positive at schools that value humanities depth. Neutral at most schools. The SAT math score is the main vulnerability.

### Parameter Table

| School | Tier | Published Admit Rate | Adjusted Admit Rate (Jaylen) | QB Match Probability | P(Merit Scholarship) | Merit Amount (Annual) | P(Honors) | Est. Net Cost/Year (No Merit) | Est. Net Cost/Year (With Merit) |
|--------|------|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|

**Notes on the table:**
- "Full need met" schools (Vanderbilt, Emory, Davidson, Denison, Richmond) don't offer traditional "merit scholarships." Instead, they calculate your financial need and cover it with grants. At $72K income, the net cost is roughly the same whether you call it merit or need-based. The result is approximately $2,000-4,000/year.
- Howard and Morehouse net costs are highly variable because they DON'T consistently meet full need. The "no merit" cost at these schools could exceed your $15K cap.
- UGA is modeled with separate probabilities for HOPE (3.0+ GPA, very likely) and Zell Miller (3.7+ GPA and 1200+ SAT, less certain). The net cost depends heavily on which scholarship he qualifies for.
- Georgia State is modeled as a commuter option ($4,500/yr with HOPE) or residential ($10,500/yr). The simulation uses the residential cost as the baseline.
- QuestBridge Match probability is the probability of matching through the National College Match specifically, which is a higher bar than general admission. If he doesn't match, his application still goes to Regular Decision.
- Adjusted admit rates account for Jaylen's demographic profile, first-gen status, and projected academic credentials at the "optimistic" level. At the "realistic" (lower) profile level, subtract approximately 3-5 percentage points from each adjusted rate.

**Assumptions I'm making (and you should know about):**
1. These admit rates are based on recent published data (CDS 2023-2025 where available). Admit rates shift year to year, sometimes significantly. By 2029-2030, these numbers could be different.
2. Financial aid policies could change. Endowments grow (or shrink). New programs launch. Use these estimates for planning, but verify the current policies when Jaylen applies.
3. The Pell Grant estimate (~$2,500/year) assumes continued eligibility at $72K income for a family of 3. If your income changes meaningfully, this number changes too.
4. I'm assuming Jaylen hits the "optimistic" profile (3.75 GPA, ~1340 SAT, strong extracurriculars). If he lands at the "realistic" profile (3.55 GPA, ~1230 SAT), the admit and merit probabilities drop. The simulation runs both scenarios.

## Monte Carlo Simulation Code

The code below runs 10,000 simulated versions of Jaylen's application cycle. In each simulation, for each school, the model draws random outcomes for admission, merit scholarships, honors programs, and special programs (QuestBridge Match, HOPE/Zell Miller). It then calculates the best financial outcome available in that simulation, the number of acceptances, and the tier of the best school admitted to.

This is not a prediction. It's a probability distribution. It tells you: given what we know and what we're assuming, what range of outcomes should you plan for?
