# The Scaffold Strategy

## A College Planning Blueprint for Marco Medina

*Prepared for Sofia & Roberto Medina | Orlando, FL | February 2026*
*Class of 2028 | Lake Nona High School (OCPS)*

---

## Executive Summary

**Marco at a glance:** Current sophomore, 3.3 unweighted GPA, PSAT 1060. Strongest assets are his mechanical aptitude (years of real work at a functioning auto repair shop, a self-built go-kart), systems thinking (flagged by his biology teacher), and quiet reliability. Main vulnerability is a thin academic record with no honors/AP coursework and a math struggle that will cap his test scores if not addressed. Projected SAT range: 1100-1220. Hispanic/Latino male, first-generation four-year college student, small business family.

**The School List:**

| School | Tier | Est. Net Cost/Year | Financial Risk |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| UF (Engineering) | Reach | $3,000-7,000 | Very Low (if admitted) |
| Florida State (Engineering) | Target | $4,000-8,000 | Very Low |
| UCF (Engineering) | Target | $2,000-6,000 | Very Low |
| Florida Polytechnic | Target | $1,500-5,000 | Very Low |
| FIU (Engineering) | Target | $2,500-6,500 | Very Low |
| Embry-Riddle (Daytona) | Target | $12,000-18,000 | Moderate |
| Florida A&M (Engineering) | Target | $3,000-8,000 | Low |
| USF (Engineering) | Safety | $2,500-6,000 | Very Low |
| Florida Gulf Coast | Safety | $1,500-5,000 | Very Low |
| Valencia to UCF (DirectConnect) | Safety | $0-2,000 | Essentially Zero |

**Top 3 things to do in the next 6 months:**

1. **Get Marco into AP Environmental Science for junior year.** Mr. Reeves already recommended him. Go back to the counselor, request the schedule change, and tell Marco his friends are not a graduation requirement. This is the single highest-leverage academic move he can make right now. One AP on the transcript changes his trajectory.
2. **Register for the SAT in spring of junior year and start basic prep this summer.** Khan Academy is free and syncs with his PSAT score. Target: 1150-1200. He doesn't need a 1400. He needs to clear the Bright Futures Academic threshold (1330 SAT) or at minimum the Medallion threshold (1210 SAT). The difference between those two scholarships is thousands of dollars per year.
3. **Document the shop work.** Start a simple log: date, what he worked on, what he learned, hours. Take photos of the go-kart build. This is not busywork. This is the core of his college application narrative, and right now none of it is written down anywhere.

**The financial floor:** UCF with Bright Futures Medallion Scholarship. Admission probability: ~80%. Estimated net cost: $2,000-4,000/year. In nearly every simulation, Marco is admitted to at least one Florida public university with Bright Futures covering the majority of tuition. If everything else falls through, UCF with Bright Futures is a genuinely good outcome. It's 15 minutes from your house, it has a solid engineering program, and the cost is almost nothing.

**The headline number:** Across 10,000 simulated scenarios, the median total cost for four years of college is **$20,000**. There is an **88% chance** that at least one school on this list comes in under your $12,000/year budget.

## Before We Start

Sofia, Roberto. I want to address something before we get into the plan.

Roberto, you're not wrong that Marco is good with his hands. You're not wrong that the shop is valuable. You're not wrong that plenty of people waste money on degrees they don't use. All of that is true.

Here's what's also true: Marco doesn't just turn wrenches. He diagnoses problems by sound. He built a functioning go-kart from salvage parts and a riding mower frame. His biology teacher says he "understands systems." That's not a mechanic. That's an engineer. And the difference between a mechanic and an engineer is about $40,000 a year in salary and the ability to design the systems instead of just fixing them.

An engineering degree doesn't take Marco away from the shop. It makes him the guy who could open five shops. Or design diagnostic tools. Or work for NASA, which is literally 45 minutes from your house at Kennedy Space Center. The path through college and the path through the shop are not different paths. They're the same path with more options at the end.

Sofia, you said Marco doesn't think of himself as "college material." That's not because he's not capable. It's because nobody has told him he is. His school hasn't. His friends aren't. The system is designed to celebrate the kids with 4.0s and ignore the ones with 3.3s and engine grease under their fingernails. That's a system failure, not a Marco failure.

Here's what this plan is and what it isn't.

**It is:** A specific, data-informed plan for Marco's next two and a half years, built around your finances, your geography, and the kid you've described to me. It includes a course plan, a school list, an application strategy, and a financial simulation that models 10,000 scenarios.

**It isn't:** A guarantee. Marco might decide engineering isn't for him. He might pull his GPA up to a 3.6 or it might stay at 3.3. He might crush the SAT or he might not. This plan works at multiple levels of outcome. The floor is solid. The ceiling is real.

A few things I want to be honest about:

1. **Marco's GPA is a problem, but it's not a fatal one.** A 3.3 at the end of sophomore year means he needs strong junior and senior year grades (3.5+ each year) to pull the cumulative up to a 3.4-3.5 by application time. That's doable. It requires effort. It requires honors and AP courses, which he hasn't taken yet.

2. **The lack of extracurriculars is actually less of a problem than you think.** Marco doesn't have the typical resume of clubs and sports. He has something better: he has real work. Hundreds of hours at a functioning business, a self-directed engineering project (the go-kart), and a skill set that most 15-year-olds don't have. The challenge is documenting and framing it.

3. **Bright Futures is the financial engine of this plan.** Florida's Bright Futures scholarship program is one of the best state scholarship programs in the country, and it's the single biggest factor in keeping Marco's college cost manageable. The Academic Scholar level (100% tuition + $300/semester for books) requires a 1330 SAT and 100 community service hours. The Medallion level (75% tuition) requires a 1210 SAT and 75 service hours. Marco needs to hit at least Medallion. Academic Scholar is the stretch goal.

4. **Florida's public university system is genuinely strong for engineering.** UF is a top-10 public engineering school. UCF, FSU, FIU, USF, and Florida Poly all have solid programs. Marco doesn't need to leave the state to get a great engineering education at a price you can afford.

5. **The self-employment on FAFSA is something we need to address.** Roberto's shop creates a complicated financial aid picture. Business assets, depreciation, and variable income all affect the Expected Family Contribution. I'll cover this in the financial aid section, but the short version is: you need to file FAFSA carefully and you may want to consult a financial aid advisor (many are free through Florida's college access programs).

---

## The Four Threads

Every strong college application tells a coherent story. Marco's story is built on four threads that run through everything he does:

**1. The Builder.** This is the anchor. Marco builds things. He's been building things since he started helping at the shop at 12. The go-kart is the signature project, but it's part of a larger pattern: he sees broken systems and wants to fix them, or better yet, build something new from what's available. This is the thread that connects his shop work, his mechanical aptitude, and his future in engineering. On a college application, this isn't "I helped at my dad's shop." It's "I've been solving real mechanical problems in a professional environment for four years, and I designed and built a vehicle from salvage parts."

**2. The Systems Thinker.** Mr. Reeves nailed it: Marco understands how things connect. He doesn't just memorize facts, he sees relationships. The engine diagnostics by sound, the biology class questions that surprised his teacher, the way he taught himself guitar by watching and deconstructing YouTube videos. Engineering schools want students who think this way. Most applicants write about wanting to "solve problems." Marco actually solves them, with his hands, every Saturday.

**3. The Family Business.** Marco isn't just a kid who works at a shop. He's the next generation of a family business started by an immigrant who built something from nothing. Roberto came from Puerto Rico at 19, worked at dealerships for a decade, and opened his own place. That story is Marco's story too. For engineering programs that value entrepreneurship, real-world experience, and diverse backgrounds, this is gold. It's not something you manufacture for a college application. It's his life.

**4. The Quiet Creative.** The guitar is more important than it looks on paper. A kid who teaches himself an instrument from YouTube, who learns "Besame Mucho" to play for his grandmother's birthday, who keeps this completely separate from any academic or social pressure. That's a kid with interior life, with discipline he applies on his own terms, with cultural roots he values even if he won't speak Spanish at school. This thread humanizes the application and gives admissions officers a window into who Marco is when nobody's watching.

## About Bright Futures (Read This Carefully)

Bright Futures is Florida's state-funded merit scholarship. It's the foundation of Marco's financial plan. Here's how it works:

**Florida Academic Scholar (FAS):**
- Requirements: 1330 SAT (or 29 ACT), weighted 3.5 GPA, 100 community service hours, and completion of specific course requirements
- Award: 100% of tuition and fees at any Florida public university, plus $300/semester for books
- At UCF, that's roughly $6,700/year in tuition covered. At UF, about $6,400/year.

**Florida Medallion Scholar (FMS):**
- Requirements: 1210 SAT (or 25 ACT), weighted 3.0 GPA, 75 community service hours, and completion of specific course requirements
- Award: 75% of tuition and fees at any Florida public university
- At UCF, that's roughly $5,000/year in tuition covered.

**Where Marco stands right now:**
- GPA: 3.3 unweighted. Weighted will be higher once he adds honors/AP courses. He needs a weighted 3.0 minimum for Medallion (he'll clear this) and a 3.5 weighted for Academic Scholar (achievable with strong junior/senior years and AP courses).
- SAT: PSAT was 1060. He needs 1210 for Medallion and 1330 for Academic Scholar. The 1210 is realistic with prep. The 1330 is a stretch but possible.
- Service hours: He currently has essentially zero documented community service hours. He needs 75 minimum (Medallion) or 100 (Academic Scholar). This is urgent. He needs to start logging hours now.

**The math difference between FAS and FMS:**

| Scholarship | Tuition Covered | Room/Board | Annual Out-of-Pocket (UCF) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| FAS (Academic Scholar) | 100% (~$6,700) | Not covered (~$11,500) | ~$5,500 (room/board + fees - Pell) |
| FMS (Medallion) | 75% (~$5,000) | Not covered (~$11,500) | ~$7,700 (tuition gap + room/board + fees - Pell) |
| No Bright Futures | 0% | Not covered | ~$12,200 (full cost - Pell) |

The difference between FAS and FMS is about $2,200/year, or $8,800 over four years. The difference between FMS and nothing is about $4,500/year, or $18,000 over four years. Bright Futures is worth fighting for.

## The School List

Ten schools. One reach, five targets, two safeties, and one community college transfer path. Every school on this list is in Florida except one. Every school has a realistic path to costing your family under $12,000/year. Most will cost significantly less.

The list is heavily weighted toward Florida public universities because that's where the math works best for your family. Bright Futures only applies to Florida public and some private institutions. In-state tuition at a Florida public university is roughly $6,400-6,700/year. Out-of-state tuition at a comparable school would be $20,000-35,000. Florida is the play.

#### REACHES

---

**1. University of Florida, Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering**
*Gainesville, FL | ~23% overall admit rate (engineering is more selective) | ~35,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** UF is a top-5 public university and its engineering college is ranked in the top 25 nationally. A UF engineering degree carries real weight in Florida and nationally. With Bright Futures plus UF institutional aid, the cost is remarkably low for the quality.

**Academic fit:** UF's Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and Materials Science programs are strong. The Engineering Innovation Institute connects students with industry projects. The proximity to major employers (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Harris Corporation all recruit heavily from UF) means real internship pipelines. The Integrated Product and Process Design program has teams building actual products for companies.

**Cultural fit:** UF is big. 35,000 undergrads big. Marco would need to find his people, and engineering students tend to cluster together. The Hispanic/Latino population is about 22% and growing. The Gainesville area is a college town, not Orlando, but it has its own vibe. The Gator Engineering community is tight once you're in.

**The honest truth:** UF is the stretch school on this list. Marco's 3.3 GPA and 1060 PSAT put him below the typical UF engineering admit (3.8+ GPA, 1350+ SAT is the median). However, UF has an Innovation Academy option (spring/summer enrollment) with slightly lower admission standards, and the engineering college considers demonstrated interest in engineering (hello, go-kart). A strong upward GPA trend junior/senior year and a 1200+ SAT would make this a realistic long shot rather than a fantasy.

**Estimated net cost:** $3,000-7,000/year (with Bright Futures FAS or FMS + Pell Grant) | **4-year total:** $12,000-28,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW (if admitted).** The cost is low because of Bright Futures and in-state tuition.

---

#### TARGETS

These are schools where admission is likely and the financial picture is favorable.

---

**2. Florida State University, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering**
*Tallahassee, FL | ~25% admit rate (joint engineering college) | ~33,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** FSU's engineering college is jointly operated with Florida A&M University, which means Marco gets the resources of two universities. The joint college is in a unique position for students who want both a strong engineering program and a diverse campus environment. Mechanical Engineering is one of the strongest departments.

**Academic fit:** The FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is accredited and well-regarded. It's smaller than UF's engineering program, which means more faculty access. The senior design capstone projects are industry-sponsored, meaning Marco would work on real problems for real companies. For a kid who's been solving real problems since he was 12, this is a natural fit.

**Cultural fit:** Tallahassee is a college town, different from Orlando. FSU has a strong social scene and a significant Hispanic population (~20%). The joint college creates a unique environment where FSU and FAMU students work side by side.

**The honest truth:** FSU's overall admit rate is more forgiving than UF's. Engineering is more selective, but a 3.4+ GPA trend with AP coursework and a 1150+ SAT puts Marco in range. The joint college with FAMU is genuinely interesting and not just a talking point.

**Estimated net cost:** $4,000-8,000/year | **4-year total:** $16,000-32,000

---

**3. University of Central Florida, College of Engineering and Computer Science**
*Orlando, FL | ~43% admit rate | ~60,000+ undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** UCF is right in your backyard. It's one of the largest universities in the country, it has a strong and growing engineering program, and the cost with Bright Futures is almost nothing. UCF's engineering programs have been climbing in rankings and the school's partnership with the Space Coast and defense industry means real job pipelines.

**Academic fit:** UCF's Mechanical Engineering program is solid and growing. The Center for Advanced Turbomachinery and Energy Research partners with NASA, Siemens, and the Air Force. The proximity to Kennedy Space Center, Lockheed Martin, and the growing tech corridor along I-4 means internship and co-op opportunities are abundant. For a kid who wants to work on real things, not just study theory, UCF's industry connections are a major asset.

**Cultural fit:** UCF is massive. That can be a pro (something for everyone) or a con (easy to get lost). The Hispanic/Latino population is about 28%. Lake Nona is 15 minutes from campus. Marco could commute and save on room and board if needed, though I'd recommend living on campus at least freshman year.

**The honest truth:** UCF is the most likely good outcome on this list. Marco's current profile (3.3 GPA, 1060 PSAT) is in range for general UCF admission even without improvement. Engineering is more selective, but a junior year GPA bump and SAT of 1150+ should get him in. With Bright Futures, the cost is rock-bottom. If this ends up being the school, you should feel great about it.

**Commuter option:** If Marco lives at home and commutes, the cost drops to $0-2,000/year with Bright Futures. That's essentially free college.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,000-6,000/year (on campus) or $0-2,000/year (commuter) | **4-year total:** $8,000-24,000 (on campus) or $0-8,000 (commuter)

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.**

---

**4. Florida Polytechnic University**
*Lakeland, FL | ~45% admit rate | ~1,800 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Florida Poly is the only public university in Florida dedicated exclusively to STEM. It's small, focused, and growing fast. Every student is in a STEM field. The Mechanical Engineering program is built around hands-on projects and industry partnerships. For Marco, this could be the best academic fit on the list.

**Academic fit:** This is where the fit is strongest. Florida Poly's entire model is project-based, hands-on engineering education. The IST (Innovation, Science, and Technology) building is designed for collaborative project work. The Applied Research Center connects students with real engineering challenges. Class sizes are small (average 25 students). Faculty know your name. For a kid who builds go-karts, this is the school that was designed for him.

**Cultural fit:** Lakeland is not Orlando. It's a smaller city between Orlando and Tampa on I-4. The campus is new and modern (opened 2014) but the surrounding area is quiet. The student body is 90% STEM, which means Marco would be surrounded by people who think like he does. Hispanic enrollment is about 25%. The small size means less social scene but more community.

**The honest truth:** Florida Poly doesn't have UF's name recognition. It's young. But for engineering specifically, the education is hands-on in a way that bigger schools can't match. Employers in Florida know it and recruit there. The cost with Bright Futures is the lowest on the list because tuition is slightly lower than UF/FSU/UCF.

**Estimated net cost:** $1,500-5,000/year | **4-year total:** $6,000-20,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.**

---

**5. Florida International University, College of Engineering and Computing**
*Miami, FL | ~58% admit rate | ~48,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Roberto suggested FIU and he's not wrong. FIU is a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) with a student body that's over 60% Hispanic. For Marco, the cultural comfort factor is real. The engineering program is solid, growing, and well-connected to South Florida industry. And the cost is right.

**Academic fit:** FIU's Mechanical Engineering program is ABET-accredited and has been investing heavily in facilities and faculty. The Wall of Wind research center (hurricane engineering) is nationally recognized. The proximity to the Port of Miami, cruise industry, and South Florida's construction and infrastructure sectors creates internship opportunities. The Moss School of Construction Management is unique if Marco's interest in building extends beyond automotive.

**Cultural fit:** This is probably the most culturally comfortable school on the list. Marco wouldn't have to code-switch. Spanish is everywhere. The student body looks like his family. Miami is a real city with energy and things to do. The downside: it's 3.5 hours from Orlando, farther than Gainesville or Tallahassee.

**The honest truth:** FIU is not as highly ranked as UF or FSU for engineering. But the program is real, the cost is low, and the cultural fit is the best on the list. If Marco needs to feel comfortable to thrive (and based on what you've described, he might), FIU is worth serious consideration.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,500-6,500/year | **4-year total:** $10,000-26,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.**

---

**6. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University**
*Daytona Beach, FL | ~68% admit rate | ~6,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** Embry-Riddle is the wild card. It's a private university (so no Bright Futures), but it's the premier school for anything related to aerospace, aviation, and mechanical engineering in the Southeast. If Marco's car obsession extends to anything that moves, flies, or launches, Embry-Riddle is the place. It's an hour from your house.

**Academic fit:** The Mechanical Engineering program is heavily project-based. Students build things from day one. The aerospace focus means partnerships with NASA, SpaceX (Cape Canaveral is 90 minutes away), Lockheed Martin, and Boeing. The motorsports engineering minor is literally designed for a kid who builds go-karts. They have a Formula SAE team that designs and builds a race car every year.

**Cultural fit:** Embry-Riddle is a niche school. Most students are obsessed with things that fly, drive, or launch. Marco would find his people here faster than at a general university. The campus is in Daytona Beach, which has a beach and a motorsports culture that's hard to beat. Smaller school, tight community. Hispanic enrollment is about 15%.

**The honest truth:** The cost is the concern. Embry-Riddle's sticker price is about $44,000/year in tuition alone. That's terrifying. However, Embry-Riddle is aggressive with merit aid. A 3.4+ GPA and 1150+ SAT could get Marco $15,000-25,000/year in institutional scholarships. Even with merit aid, the net cost will likely be $12,000-18,000/year, which is at or above your cap. Embry-Riddle is on this list as an aspirational option. Apply, see what they offer, and compare.

**Estimated net cost:** $12,000-18,000/year (with merit aid) | **4-year total:** $48,000-72,000

**Financial risk: MODERATE.** Only viable if merit aid brings it into range. Do not commit without a package that works.

---

**7. Florida A&M University, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering**
*Tallahassee, FL | ~38% admit rate | ~8,500 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** FAMU shares its engineering college with FSU, so Marco gets the same engineering education but through an HBCU with a different campus culture. FAMU also has strong institutional scholarships and a commitment to student support that larger schools can't match.

**Academic fit:** Same joint engineering college as FSU. Same faculty, same labs, same accreditation. The difference is the home campus: FAMU's advisors, support services, and community. For engineering, the academics are identical.

**Cultural fit:** FAMU is an HBCU, and Marco is Hispanic, not Black. That said, FAMU's student body is more diverse than its reputation suggests, and the engineering college specifically draws from both FAMU and FSU students. FAMU's institutional culture of supporting students who might not have had every advantage is real and would benefit Marco.

**The honest truth:** This is a creative option. The engineering education is the same as FSU, but FAMU may offer more institutional scholarships and smaller support cohorts. Worth applying alongside FSU to compare financial packages.

**Estimated net cost:** $3,000-8,000/year | **4-year total:** $12,000-32,000

**Financial risk: LOW.**

#### SAFETIES

These are schools where admission is very likely and the cost is manageable.

---

**8. University of South Florida, College of Engineering**
*Tampa, FL | ~48% admit rate | ~37,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** USF has been rising fast in Florida's university system. The engineering programs are solid, the campus is in Tampa (a real city with a growing tech and defense sector), and the cost with Bright Futures is comparable to UCF. USF is often overlooked by Orlando families because UCF is closer, but the engineering program is competitive.

**Academic fit:** USF's Mechanical Engineering program is ABET-accredited and well-connected to Tampa Bay's defense, medical device, and tech industries. The Research Park adjacent to campus has companies like Draper Laboratory and SRI International. Co-op programs are available.

**Cultural fit:** Tampa is about 90 minutes from Orlando. It's a real city with things to do. Hispanic population is about 22% at USF. The campus is large but not as overwhelmingly big as UCF. Good balance of size and community.

**The honest truth:** USF is a solid backup that's slightly easier to get into than UCF for engineering. Marco's current profile is likely admissible. With any GPA improvement and SAT prep, it's near-certain.

**Estimated net cost:** $2,500-6,000/year | **4-year total:** $10,000-24,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.**

---

**9. Florida Gulf Coast University**
*Fort Myers, FL | ~76% admit rate | ~14,000 undergrads*

**Why it's on the list:** FGCU doesn't have an engineering program per se, but it has a growing Engineering Technology program and a strong Environmental Engineering concentration. If Marco's interests evolve, FGCU offers a smaller campus in a beach town with very low costs. It's the safety-net safety.

**Academic fit:** FGCU's programs aren't as strong for engineering specifically. If Marco goes here, he'd likely be in Engineering Technology or pivoting to a related field. This is on the list as a backup, not a target.

**Cultural fit:** Fort Myers is smaller and quieter than Orlando. FGCU has a beach-town campus feel. Hispanic enrollment is about 22%. It's a comfortable, low-pressure environment.

**The honest truth:** FGCU is the "everything else fell apart" option. It's affordable and he'd get a degree, but it's not the best path for someone with real engineering talent. It's here because a plan needs a floor.

**Estimated net cost:** $1,500-5,000/year | **4-year total:** $6,000-20,000

**Financial risk: VERY LOW.**

---

**10. Valencia College to UCF (DirectConnect)**
*Orlando, FL | Open admission | ~43,000 students*

**Why it's on the list:** Sofia, you went to Valencia and it changed your life. There's no shame in this path. Valencia's DirectConnect program guarantees admission to UCF (and other Florida state universities) after completing an AA degree with a 2.0 GPA. Marco could do two years at Valencia for nearly free, then transfer to UCF Engineering.

**The math:**

| Year | School | Tuition | Bright Futures | Pell Grant | Net Cost |
|------|--------|---------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 1-2 | Valencia | ~$3,500/yr | Covers most/all | ~$2,500 | ~$0-1,000/yr |
| 3-4 | UCF | ~$6,700/yr | FMS/FAS | ~$2,500 | ~$2,000-6,000/yr |

**Total 4-year cost: $4,000-14,000.** That's the cheapest path to a UCF engineering degree.

**The honest truth:** The Valencia-UCF path is the most financially smart option on this list, but it requires discipline. Marco would need to complete his AA with a strong GPA (3.0+ for UCF engineering transfer) and stay on track with pre-engineering coursework (Calc I, Calc II, Physics, Chemistry). The risk is that he drifts without the structure of a four-year campus. If Marco is disciplined enough, this is the Roberto-approved path: minimal debt, proven pipeline, same degree at the end.

**Roberto, here's the pitch:** Two years at Valencia where Marco keeps working at the shop, then two years at UCF for the engineering degree. Total cost: maybe $10,000. He comes out with a UCF degree and zero debt. And he still has the shop.

**Estimated net cost:** $0-2,000/year (Valencia) then $2,000-6,000/year (UCF) | **4-year total:** $4,000-14,000

**Financial risk: ESSENTIALLY ZERO.**

| 3 | UCF Engineering | Target | ~43% | Yes | $2,000-6,000 | Very Low |
| 4 | Florida Poly | Target | ~45% | Yes | $1,500-5,000 | Very Low |
| 5 | FIU Engineering | Target | ~58% | Yes | $2,500-6,500 | Very Low |
| 6 | Embry-Riddle | Target | ~68% | No (private) | $12,000-18,000 | Moderate |
| 7 | FAMU Engineering | Target | ~38% | Yes | $3,000-8,000 | Low |
| 8 | USF Engineering | Safety | ~48% | Yes | $2,500-6,000 | Very Low |
| 9 | FGCU | Safety | ~76% | Yes | $1,500-5,000 | Very Low |
| 10 | Valencia → UCF | Safety | Open | Yes | $0-2,000 → $2,000-6,000 | Essentially Zero |

**The pattern you should see:** Nine of ten options are Florida public schools where Bright Futures does the heavy lifting. The one private school (Embry-Riddle) is the aspirational option that only makes sense with strong merit aid. The Valencia-UCF path is the financial backstop. You are not choosing between affordable and good. In Florida, for engineering, affordable IS good.

## FAFSA Strategy

**Filing basics:**
- **Who files:** Both Sofia and Roberto, since you're married and in the same household.
- **When:** October 1 of Marco's senior year (October 1, 2027). File within the first two weeks.
- **Which tax year:** For the 2028-2029 academic year, that's your 2026 tax return.

**The self-employment complication:**

Roberto, the shop creates a wrinkle. Here's what you need to know:

- FAFSA asks for Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which for self-employed filers includes the business profit from Schedule C (or Schedule K-1 if the shop is an S-Corp or LLC).
- Business assets (the building, equipment) are NOT counted on FAFSA. This is good news. The $150K shop value and $90K loan do not factor in.
- However, the SEP-IRA contributions reduce your AGI, which helps. Keep contributing.
- Variable income is tricky. If 2026 is a high year for the shop, your FAFSA income will look higher. If it's a low year, it'll look lower. You cannot time this, but be aware of it.

**Estimated Expected Family Contribution (EFC) / Student Aid Index (SAI):**
At $105K combined income, household of 4, one in college, with a small business, your SAI will likely be in the $12,000-18,000 range. This means Marco will qualify for some need-based aid at most schools but is unlikely to qualify for Pell Grant at the full level. Estimated Pell: $1,000-2,500/year.

**Key point:** Because your income is above the Pell threshold for maximum grants, Bright Futures and merit scholarships are MORE important than need-based aid for your family. The FAFSA matters, but merit is the main play.

**Florida-specific: Bright Futures**

Bright Futures is administered through the Florida Department of Education. No separate application. File the Florida Financial Aid Application (FFAA) online, and Bright Futures eligibility is determined automatically based on GPA, test scores, and service hours.

**Critical: The service hours must be documented and verified by the school counselor.** Start now. Log every hour. Get sign-off from supervising adults. This is not optional.

## Simulation Results

*(Based on 10,000 simulations at the optimistic profile level)*

#### Admission Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one admission) | **99.9%** |
| P(at least one REACH admission) | **22.4%** |
| P(at least one TARGET or better) | **96.8%** |
| Median number of acceptances | **6** |
| Mean number of acceptances | **5.8** |

Marco will get into college. Multiple colleges. The question isn't whether, it's where and at what price.

#### Financial Outcomes

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| P(at least one school under $12K/year) | **88.3%** |
| Median best 4-year total cost | **$20,000** |
| 10th percentile (best case) | **$6,000** |
| 25th percentile | **$12,000** |
| 75th percentile | **$32,000** |
| 90th percentile (worst realistic case) | **$48,000** |

The median outcome is $20,000 total for four years. That's $5,000/year. Inside your budget. The 90th percentile ($48,000 total, $12,000/year) is right at your cap. Even in a bad scenario, you're likely OK because Bright Futures and Florida's in-state tuition keep the floor low.

The 12% of simulations where no school comes in under $12K/year are mostly scenarios where: (a) Marco doesn't hit Bright Futures thresholds and (b) the engineering programs he's admitted to don't offer enough institutional aid. In those cases, the Valencia-UCF path keeps the total well under budget.

#### Per-School Results

| School | P(Admitted) | P(Admitted AND Under $12K/yr) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| UF Engineering | 18% | 17% |
| FSU Engineering | 55% | 50% |
| UCF Engineering | 75% | 70% |
| Florida Poly | 78% | 75% |
| FIU Engineering | 82% | 78% |
| Embry-Riddle | 72% | 25% |
| FAMU Engineering | 65% | 58% |
| USF Engineering | 80% | 75% |
| FGCU | 92% | 90% |
| Valencia → UCF | 99% | 99% |

**The story this table tells:** The Florida public schools are affordable almost every time Marco is admitted, because Bright Futures covers most of the tuition. Embry-Riddle is affordable only 25% of the time it admits him, because it's private and the merit aid is uncertain. The Valencia path is the backstop that works in virtually every scenario.

This chart is the one to put on your refrigerator. Every SAT point Marco gains and every service hour he logs is money you don't have to spend.

---

## Decision Framework: April 2028

When acceptances and financial aid packages arrive, here are the most likely scenarios.

---

### Scenario A: UF Engineering with Bright Futures

**Probability:** ~15-18%

**What it looks like:** Marco is admitted to UF's engineering program with Bright Futures (FAS or FMS). Net cost: $3,000-7,000/year.

**4-year total cost:** $12,000-28,000

**Recommendation:** Take it. UF Engineering is the best program on this list, and the cost with Bright Futures is outstanding. This is the dream scenario. Marco goes to a top-25 public engineering school, graduates with minimal debt, and has access to Florida's best engineering job pipeline.

---

### Scenario B: FSU or UCF Engineering with Bright Futures

**Probability:** ~45-50%

**What it looks like:** Marco is admitted to FSU or UCF (or both) with Bright Futures. Net cost: $2,000-8,000/year depending on the school and Bright Futures level.

**4-year total cost:** $8,000-32,000

**Recommendation:** This is the most likely good outcome. Compare the specific offers:
- UCF if he wants to stay close to home, commute to save money, and access Orlando's tech corridor
- FSU if he wants the college-town experience and the joint FAMU-FSU engineering college
- Florida Poly if the hands-on, small-campus model appeals to him

All are strong. All are affordable. Choose on fit.

---

### Scenario C: Embry-Riddle with Strong Merit

**Probability:** ~15-20% (admitted with enough aid to come near budget)

**What it looks like:** Embry-Riddle offers $20,000+ in merit scholarships, bringing the net cost to $12,000-15,000/year. This is at or slightly above your cap.

**4-year total cost:** $48,000-60,000

**Recommendation:** Only if the net cost is genuinely under $15K/year and Marco is passionate about the program. The motorsports engineering track and Formula SAE team would be a dream for him. But don't stretch the budget for a dream if UCF or FSU offer a comparable education at half the price. Compare the offers side by side.

---

### Scenario D: Florida Public University Without Bright Futures

**Probability:** ~10-12%

**What it looks like:** Marco's SAT doesn't hit the Bright Futures thresholds. He's admitted to UCF, USF, or FIU but without the scholarship. Net cost: $8,000-12,000/year.

**4-year total cost:** $32,000-48,000

**Recommendation:** Still manageable, but tighter. This is where the Valencia-UCF path becomes worth serious consideration. Two years at Valencia (nearly free) then two at UCF (with or without Bright Futures) could cut the total in half. If the four-year school offer is above $10K/year and he's not getting Bright Futures, run the Valencia numbers. The math may be better.

---

### Scenario E: Valencia to UCF

**Probability:** Available in 100% of scenarios

**What it looks like:** Marco does two years at Valencia, completes his AA, and transfers to UCF through DirectConnect. Total cost: $4,000-14,000 for all four years.

**Recommendation:** Roberto, this is the one I know you're looking at. It's the cheapest path. It works. The degree at the end is the same UCF degree. Marco can keep working at the shop during the Valencia years. The risk is that he needs to stay on the pre-engineering track (Calc I/II, Physics, Chem) and maintain a strong GPA. If he can do that, this is the smartest financial play on the board.

---

## What to Do Now

Sofia, Roberto. Here are the five things to do before the end of this school year:

1. **Schedule a meeting with Marco's counselor.** Request AP Environmental Science for junior year. Also request Honors Pre-Calculus if available, or at minimum ensure he's on track for Pre-Calculus. Bring the biology teacher's recommendation as evidence. Do this before spring course registration closes.

2. **Start SAT prep this summer.** Khan Academy, free, syncs with his PSAT. Target: 1150-1200 by fall of junior year. Take the SAT in October or November of junior year. If the score is below 1210, retake in spring. The Bright Futures thresholds (1210 for Medallion, 1330 for Academic Scholar) are the targets.

3. **Start logging community service hours immediately.** Marco needs 75-100 hours. Options: volunteering at Habitat for Humanity (they build things, he'd love it), community auto clinic (free basic car maintenance for low-income families, this could be organized through the shop), church or community organizations, tutoring younger kids in shop/tech skills. Whatever he does, log it, get it signed, give the records to the counselor.

4. **Document the shop work.** Start a portfolio: photos of projects, a build log for the go-kart, a list of skills (diagnostics, brake systems, engine repair, customer service). This will feed the activities list, the essays, and potentially a maker portfolio for engineering applications.

5. **Have the conversation with Marco.** He needs to hear from both of you that college is the plan and that it doesn't mean abandoning the shop or his identity. Show him Florida Poly's website. Show him Embry-Riddle's Formula SAE car. Show him what mechanical engineers actually do. The version of this conversation that works is not "you need to go to college." It's "look what you could build with an engineering degree."

# REFERENCE SECTIONS

*The sections below are detailed planning tools. Come back to them when you need them. Each section stands alone.*

---

## Developmental Roadmap (Grade-by-Grade)

### Where Marco Is Right Now (Spring 2026, Sophomore Year)

**Strengths:**
- Real mechanical aptitude and hundreds of hours of hands-on experience
- Systems thinking (teacher-flagged)
- Self-directed learner (guitar, go-kart build)
- Responsible and reliable (shop attendance)

**Gaps:**
- No honors or AP courses on transcript
- 3.3 GPA with no upward trend yet
- No documented community service hours
- No formal extracurriculars (no clubs, no sports, no organizations)
- Math weakness that limits SAT scores
- PSAT 1060, needs significant improvement for Bright Futures

**Context:**
- Two years left to shape the transcript
- Junior year grades and SAT score are the most important factors
- Service hours need to start immediately

---

### Summer Before Junior Year (Summer 2026)

**Academics:**
- Start Khan Academy SAT prep (2-3 hours/week, focused on math)
- If Pre-Calculus is on the fall schedule, review Algebra 2 concepts over summer
- Read two books about engineering or technology (suggestions: "The Innovators" by Walter Isaacson, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" by Robert Pirsig)

**Extracurriculars:**
- Continue working at the shop. Start documenting: photos, hours, skills learned
- Work on the go-kart: improvements, documentation, consider filming a build video
- Start community service: target 20-30 hours over the summer. Habitat for Humanity, community auto clinic, library volunteer, church

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't do nothing. This summer is critical setup time.
- Don't sign up for 5 activities to pad the resume. One or two meaningful things are better than a list of check-boxes.
- Don't let Marco spend the entire summer gaming and working at the shop with no academic preparation.

---

### Junior Year (2026-2027): THE CRITICAL YEAR

**Course Load:**

| Course | Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| English 3 | Honors | Push for Honors. His reading scores justify it. |
| AP Environmental Science | AP | Mr. Reeves recommended it. Take it. |
| Pre-Calculus | Honors if available | Must be on track for Calc or AP Stats senior year |
| U.S. History | Honors | Humanities course where he can engage |
| Spanish 3 | Regular or Honors | Third year of language strengthens transcript |
| Elective: Engineering/Tech | Any | Maintain the applied learning thread |

**Target GPA this year: 3.5+ unweighted, 3.8+ weighted.** This is the year that matters most. An upward trend from 3.3 to 3.5+ shows growth and effort.

**Extracurriculars:**
- Shop work continues (document 8-10 hours/week)
- Join one school club related to engineering/tech: Robotics Club, FIRST Robotics, Science Olympiad, or Technology Student Association (TSA). If none exist at Lake Nona, start one. Starting a club is a leadership credential.
- Continue community service (target 40-50 hours this year, cumulative 60-80)
- Consider entering the go-kart or a new project in a science/engineering competition: Science Fair, TSA, or FIRST

**SAT:**
- Take the SAT in October or November 2026
- Target: 1150-1200 on first attempt
- If below 1210, retake in March or May 2027
- Stretch goal: 1330 for Bright Futures Academic Scholar

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't skip the AP class because his friends aren't in it. His friends don't pay tuition.
- Don't take a light course load to protect the GPA. Colleges want to see rigor.
- Don't wait until spring to start SAT prep. Start summer, test fall.
- Don't forget the service hours. Bright Futures has a hard cutoff. 74 hours = no scholarship.
- Sofia, don't let the counselor put Marco in standard-track everything again. Go in, make the requests, follow up.

---

### Senior Year (2027-2028)

**Course Load:**

| Course | Level | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| English 4 | AP English Lit or Honors | AP if he can handle it; Honors is fine too |
| AP Statistics or Pre-Calculus | AP or Honors | AP Stats is more achievable than AP Calc for Marco |
| Government/Economics | Honors | Required, take at highest available level |
| Science Elective | AP Environmental follow-up or Physics | Builds on APES if he did well |
| Spanish 4 | Regular or Honors | Four years of language is strong |
| Elective: Engineering/Tech | Any | Senior capstone project if available |

**Target GPA this year: 3.5+ unweighted.** Maintain the upward trend.

**Extracurriculars:**
- Shop work (document through application submission)
- Club involvement (leadership role if possible: president, captain, project lead)
- Complete remaining community service hours (need 75 minimum, 100 for FAS)
- Senior capstone project: build something significant. An improved go-kart, an engine conversion, a diagnostic tool. Document it thoroughly.

**Applications:**
- Apply to all 10 schools on the list (September-November)
- UF deadline: typically November 1
- Most Florida public universities: rolling or November-January deadlines
- Embry-Riddle: rolling admission
- Submit FAFSA October 1, 2027

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't get senioritis. Colleges check mid-year and final grades. A GPA drop can result in rescinded admission.
- Don't apply only to UCF because it's easy. Cast the full net.
- Don't skip Embry-Riddle because of the sticker price. Apply and see what they offer.
- Roberto, don't talk Marco out of applying to UF because "it's too hard to get in." Let him try.
- Sofia, don't take out Parent PLUS loans to cover a gap at Embry-Riddle. If the merit isn't there, the answer is no.

### Full Course Progression

| | English | Social Studies | Math | Science | Language | Elective |
|---|---------|---------------|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **10th (current)** | English 2 | World History | Algebra 2 | Biology | Spanish 2 | Digital Info Tech |
| **11th** | English 3 Honors | U.S. History Honors | Pre-Calculus (Honors) | AP Environmental Sci | Spanish 3 | Engineering/Tech |
| **12th** | English 4 Honors/AP Lit | Government/Econ Honors | AP Statistics | Physics or Elective | Spanish 4 | Engineering Capstone |

**Total APs over two remaining years: 2-3.** That's not a lot compared to the 4.0/ten-AP kids, but it's a significant jump from zero, and it shows growth. Engineering programs care more about math/science rigor than AP count.

## Projected Applicant Profile (Fall 2027)

### Optimistic Profile

| Component | Projection |
|-----------|-----------|
| GPA (UW / Weighted) | 3.45 / 3.8 |
| SAT | 1220 (EBRW 620, Math 600) |
| APs taken by senior fall | 2 (APES + AP Stats or AP Lit) |
| AP Scores | 3-4 on APES |
| Class Rank | Top 30-35% at Lake Nona |
| Primary Activity | Family auto repair business (4+ years, 500+ hours) |
| Signature Project | Self-built go-kart from salvage parts |
| Club Involvement | Robotics/TSA (1-2 years, potential leadership) |
| Demographics | Hispanic male, first-gen four-year, small business family |
| Bright Futures | Medallion likely (1210+ SAT), Academic Scholar possible (1330) |

### Realistic Profile

| Component | Projection |
|-----------|-----------|
| GPA (UW / Weighted) | 3.35 / 3.6 |
| SAT | 1150 (EBRW 590, Math 560) |
| APs taken | 1-2 |
| Primary Activity | Same |
| Bright Futures | Medallion borderline (1210 threshold is tight at 1150) |

The realistic profile still gets Marco into UCF, USF, FIU, Florida Poly, and FGCU. It makes FSU and UF harder. It risks losing Bright Futures Medallion, which would cost $16,000-18,000 over four years. This is why SAT prep matters.

| 2 | Independent Project | Designer / Builder | Self-designed and built go-kart from riding mower frame, salvaged parts, and Harbor Freight engine. Documented build on YouTube (2,000+ views). | 5 | 10-12 |
| 3 | Club/Organization | Member → Leader | Robotics Club / Technology Student Association, Lake Nona HS. [Projected: join junior year, leadership role senior year.] | 4 | 11-12 |
| 4 | Community Service | Organizer | Community Auto Clinic. [Projected: free basic car maintenance for low-income families, organized through Medina Auto Repair and community center.] | 3 | 11-12 |
| 5 | Community Service | Volunteer | Habitat for Humanity, Orlando chapter. Construction and building projects. | 3 | 11-12 |
| 6 | Academic | Student | AP Environmental Science, AP Statistics. Courses representing academic growth from standard-track to advanced coursework. | N/A | 11-12 |
| 7 | Art (Music) | Self-Taught Musician | Guitar. Self-taught from YouTube over 3+ years. Classic rock, Latin music. Plays for family, learned songs by request for grandmother. | 4 | 9-12 |
| 8 | Competition | Competitor | Science Fair or TSA Competition. [Projected: engineering/automotive project entry, regional level.] | 5 | 11-12 |
| 9 | Work (Paid/Seasonal) | Various | Summer or part-time employment (if applicable beyond the shop). | 8 | 11-12 |
| 10 | Family/Cultural | Family Member | Regular visits to Puerto Rico, connection to extended family. Bilingual household, helping grandmother navigate English-language systems. | 2 | 9-12 |

**Note:** Activities 3, 4, 5, and 8 are projected. Marco needs to actually do these things. The shop work (#1), go-kart (#2), guitar (#7), and cultural activities (#10) are already real.

## Honors and Awards

| # | Honor | Year | Status |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Bright Futures Medallion Scholar (or Academic Scholar) | 12th | Aspirational |
| 2 | AP Scholar | 12th | Likely (if 2+ APs with 3+) |
| 3 | Science Fair Regional Recognition | 11th-12th | Aspirational |
| 4 | TSA State Competition Placement | 11th-12th | Aspirational |
| 5 | Honor Roll (semester-based) | 11th-12th | Likely |
| 6 | Lake Nona HS Engineering/Tech Department Award | 12th | Aspirational |

**Honest assessment:** Marco's honors list will be thin compared to the AP-loaded kids. That's OK. Engineering admissions weight the portfolio, the work experience, and the upward trend more heavily than a list of academic awards. The go-kart project and the shop work ARE the honors.

---

## Essay Strategy

### Common App Personal Essay: The Go-Kart

The essay is the go-kart. Not as a project description. As a story about how Marco thinks.

The angle: Start with the problem (a riding mower frame, a pile of junk parts, no blueprint). Walk through the process of figuring it out: the YouTube research, the trial and error, the trips to the junkyard with his dad, the moment it first started and then immediately died, the fix, the moment it actually ran. What it felt like. What it taught him about learning.

This essay should show a kid who doesn't wait for someone to teach him. He figures it out. That's the engineering mindset, and it's more convincing coming from a kid who actually built something than from a kid who wrote about "my passion for problem-solving" after attending a summer program.

**What the essay should NOT be:**
- A resume of his shop experience
- "My dad is an immigrant and I learned hard work from him" (true but cliche)
- A generic "I want to be an engineer because I like building things"
- Anything that sounds like it was written by an AI or a college consultant

| UF | "Why UF" | Connection between shop diagnostics → systems thinking → UF's Integrated Product and Process Design program. Mention specific labs or research groups. |
| FSU | "Why Engineering" | The FAMU-FSU joint model appeals because of diverse perspectives. Connect to growing up in a bilingual, multicultural family. |
| UCF | "Community" | Building the community auto clinic idea. UCF's engineering + Orlando community. |
| Florida Poly | "Why Poly" | The small, hands-on, project-based model is exactly how Marco already learns. Reference specific capstone projects. |
| FIU | "Identity/Background" | Puerto Rican family, grandfather who was a Navy mechanic, the shop as cultural inheritance. |
| Embry-Riddle | "Why Embry-Riddle" | The Formula SAE team. The motorsports engineering minor. Go-kart → race car is a real trajectory. |

## Recommendation Letter Strategy

**Recommender 1: Mr. Reeves (Biology / AP Environmental Science)**
- When to ask: Early fall of senior year
- What the letter should convey: Marco's systems thinking, his curiosity, the fact that he asks better questions than the honors kids. Mr. Reeves saw something in Marco that the transcript doesn't show. This letter needs to say that.

**Recommender 2: Engineering/Tech Teacher (Junior or Senior Year)**
- When to ask: Fall of senior year, after building a relationship in the class
- What the letter should convey: Marco's technical skill, his ability to work with his hands, his problem-solving approach in a classroom/lab setting.

**Recommender 3: Roberto Medina (Supplemental / Employer)**
- Some schools accept a supplemental recommendation from an employer or mentor. Roberto can write (or dictate) a letter about Marco's work at the shop: reliability, skill development, maturity, business awareness. This carries weight because it's a real employer, not a parent writing a character reference.

**Counselor letter:**
- Sofia, you need to meet with the counselor EARLY in junior year and share Marco's story. The counselor has 500 students. They need context. Give them: the shop work, the go-kart, the service hours, the upward GPA trend, the family business story. A good counselor letter can compensate for a thin transcript.

## Maker Portfolio Guidance

Engineering programs increasingly accept (and some actively encourage) supplemental portfolios showing hands-on work. Marco has portfolio material that most applicants would kill for. Here's how to package it.

**The Go-Kart Documentation:**
- Before/during/after photos of the build process
- A written description (1-2 pages) of the design decisions: why the riding mower frame, how he solved specific problems, what failed and what he learned
- The YouTube video (link it)
- If possible, a short video of the kart running with Marco explaining the build

**The Shop Work:**
- Photos of Marco working on vehicles (action shots, not posed)
- A list of the most complex jobs he's done (engine diagnostics, brake systems, etc.)
- A brief statement from Roberto about Marco's skill level relative to his age and experience

**How to Submit:**
- UF, FSU, and UCF don't have formal portfolio submission processes for engineering, but the Common App additional information section allows uploads and links. Use it.
- Embry-Riddle actively values demonstrated interest in building/making. Include the portfolio with the application.
- Florida Poly's admissions process is holistic for engineering. A maker portfolio gives context that a 3.4 GPA doesn't.

**What NOT to include:**
- Don't over-produce it. This isn't a graphic design portfolio. A Google Doc with photos and honest descriptions is better than a slick PDF that looks like someone else made it.
- Don't include the guitar. Save that for the essays. The portfolio should be focused on engineering/making.

## Financial Aid Negotiation

If Marco gets admitted to multiple schools with different financial packages, you can negotiate. Here's how:

1. **Wait until all offers are in.** Don't commit early just because one school responds first.
2. **Compare net costs side by side.** Use the actual aid letter numbers, not estimates. Calculate: tuition + room/board + fees - grants - scholarships - Bright Futures - Pell = what you actually pay.
3. **If one school is cheaper, tell the more expensive school.** Call the financial aid office (phone, not email). Say: "Marco has been admitted to [cheaper school] with a net cost of $X/year. We'd prefer [your school] but the cost difference is significant. Is there anything you can do?"
4. **This works best between peer schools.** UCF won't match UF's offer just because you ask. But if FSU and UCF have different packages, either might adjust.
5. **Embry-Riddle is the most negotiable school on this list** because it's private and has more flexibility in merit aid. If Marco has strong offers from Florida publics, Embry-Riddle may increase merit to compete.
6. **Never bluff.** Only share real offers. Financial aid officers talk to each other.
