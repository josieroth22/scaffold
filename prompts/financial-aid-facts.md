# College Financial Aid Reference Facts
## For injection into Scaffold prompt to improve advising accuracy
### Last updated: February 2026

> **Note:** This document is injected into the generation prompt alongside per-school verified data (CDS 2024-25 + College Scorecard) and state-specific aid programs. The per-school data provides exact costs, admit rates, and scholarship names. This document provides the broader context: which schools offer merit vs. need-only aid, CSS Profile requirements, QuestBridge details, gapping risks, and test-optional policies.

## 1. Schools That DO NOT Offer Merit Aid (Need-Based Only)

These schools award financial aid exclusively based on demonstrated financial need. A student with a 1600 SAT and 4.0 GPA will receive zero merit dollars from these institutions. If the family does not demonstrate financial need, they pay sticker price.

**All eight Ivy League schools:**
- Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell

**Other elite research universities (no merit aid):**
- Stanford
- MIT
- Caltech
- Georgetown

**Highly selective liberal arts colleges (no merit aid):**
- Amherst College
- Barnard College
- Bowdoin College
- Colby College
- Haverford College
- Middlebury College
- Pomona College
- Reed College
- Swarthmore College
- Wellesley College
- Williams College

**Key implication for families:** If a family does not qualify for need-based aid at these schools, they will pay full cost of attendance ($85K-$95K/year in 2025-26). There is no academic performance discount. Families in the $200K-$400K income range often face the worst squeeze at these schools: too wealthy to qualify for significant aid, not wealthy enough to comfortably pay sticker.

**Exception to note:** Some of these schools (e.g., Swarthmore with the McCabe Award) have a very small number of named merit-type awards, but these are rare, tiny in number, and should not be counted on strategically.

## 2. Selective Schools Known for Generous Merit Aid

These schools actively use merit scholarships to attract high-stat students. For families where the student has strong academics but the family income is too high for significant need-based aid, these schools can be dramatically cheaper than "no merit" schools.

**Top-25 caliber schools that offer significant merit aid:**
- Vanderbilt University: Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholars, Chancellor's Scholars, Ingram Scholars (full tuition, ~250 recipients/year, top 1% of applicants)
- Duke University: Robertson Scholars Leadership Program (full cost of attendance), AB Duke Scholars
- University of Chicago: UChicago Stamps Scholarship, merit awards common
- Washington University in St. Louis (WashU): Danforth Scholars, Ervin Scholars, Mylonas Scholarship, and others (full or near-full tuition)
- Rice University: Trustee Distinguished Scholarship and other named awards
- USC: Trustee Scholarship (full tuition), Presidential Scholarship (half tuition), Dean's Scholarship (quarter tuition)
- University of Notre Dame: Stamps Scholarship and other merit programs

**Schools known for generous automatic or semi-automatic merit aid to high-stat students:**
- University of Alabama: Automatic full-tuition scholarships for out-of-state students meeting GPA/test score thresholds. One of the most aggressive merit aid programs in the country.
- UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham): Automatic merit scholarships based on GPA and test scores
- Arizona State University (Barrett Honors): Strong merit packages for high-stat students
- University of South Carolina: Competitive merit and automatic awards
- Tulane University: Dean's Honor Scholarship, Stamps Leadership Award (up to full cost of attendance)
- Case Western Reserve University: Strong merit awards, especially for STEM students
- Baylor University: Generous merit that can be stacked with departmental awards
- University of Miami: Competitive merit scholarships
- SMU: Significant merit awards for high-stat students
- Fordham University: Notable merit packages

**Key implication for families:** A student with a 1550 SAT might pay $85K/year at Harvard (if no need-based aid) but attend University of Alabama on a full-tuition scholarship. The "best value" school on any list depends entirely on the intersection of the student's stats, the family's finances, and each school's specific aid policies.

## 3. Schools That Meet 100% of Demonstrated Financial Need

Approximately 70-75 colleges in the U.S. commit to meeting 100% of every admitted student's demonstrated financial need. This is a critical distinction: at the vast majority of U.S. colleges, families are "gapped" (see Section 8). These schools promise no gap.

**Ivy League (all meet 100% need):**
- Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell

**Other elite research universities:**
- Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Duke, Rice, Georgetown, Emory, Vanderbilt, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, WashU, Notre Dame, USC

**Top liberal arts colleges:**
- Amherst, Barnard, Bates, Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Claremont McKenna, Colby, Colgate, Colorado College, Davidson, Denison, Franklin & Marshall, Grinnell, Hamilton, Haverford, Lafayette, Macalester, Middlebury, Oberlin, Pomona, Reed, Richmond, Scripps, Skidmore, Smith, Swarthmore, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Williams

**Flagship publics (for in-state students typically):**
- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Virginia, College of William & Mary (varies; public schools often meet full need only for in-state or low-income students)

**No-loan policies (subset of full-need schools that replace loans with grants):**
- Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Amherst, Bowdoin, Brown, Caltech, Columbia, Dartmouth, Pomona, Rice, Swarthmore, Vanderbilt, Williams, and others have replaced student loan expectations with grant aid

**Key caveats:**
- "Meeting 100% of need" does not mean "free." The school calculates what your family should pay (your Expected Family Contribution / Student Aid Index), and covers the rest. If they calculate your EFC at $40K, you pay $40K.
- Each school uses its own methodology to calculate need. Two schools may calculate your need differently, resulting in different aid packages even though both "meet 100% of need."
- Some schools meet 100% for freshmen but not upperclassmen. Verify the commitment extends to all four years.
- Some packages include loans as part of "meeting need." A no-loan school replaces that component with grants. This matters.

**Key income thresholds at top schools (as of 2025-26):**
- Princeton: Free tuition for families earning under $250K with typical assets. Full cost of attendance covered for families under $150K.
- Harvard: Free for families under $100K. Tuition-free for families under $200K.
- Yale: Full tuition covered for families under $200K. Zero cost for families under $100K (effective 2026-27 entering class).
- Stanford: Free tuition for families under $100K. Tuition-free for families earning under $150K with typical assets.
- MIT: Free for families under $75K. Highly subsidized above that.

## 4. CSS Profile vs. FAFSA

**FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid):**
- Required by nearly all ~4,000 degree-granting U.S. colleges
- Determines eligibility for federal aid (Pell Grants, federal loans, work-study)
- Calculates the Student Aid Index (SAI), replacing the old Expected Family Contribution (EFC)
- Does NOT consider home equity, non-retirement assets in detail, or non-custodial parent income in divorced families
- Free to file

**CSS Profile (College Board):**
- Required by approximately 250-270 private colleges and scholarship programs
- More detailed than FAFSA: considers home equity, business assets, non-custodial parent income, medical expenses, and more
- Each school can customize which CSS Profile questions they weight, so aid offers vary even among CSS Profile schools
- Costs $25 for the first school and $16 per additional school (fee waivers available for low-income families)

**Schools that require CSS Profile include:**
- All Ivies, Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Duke, Georgetown, Northwestern, NYU, USC, Emory, WashU, Tufts, and most elite private colleges and universities
- Virtually all of the "meets 100% of need" private schools listed in Section 3

**Schools that use FAFSA only (examples):**
- Nearly all public universities (UCs, Big Ten schools, state flagships)
- Many less-selective private colleges

**Key implication for families:**
- The CSS Profile generally results in a higher calculated family contribution than FAFSA because it counts home equity and more assets
- Divorced/separated families: many CSS Profile schools require financial information from BOTH parents (custodial and non-custodial), regardless of custody arrangements. This can be a major factor. Check each school's non-custodial parent policy.
- Always file FAFSA even if the school requires CSS Profile. Federal aid (Pell, loans) comes through FAFSA.

## 5. Net Price Calculators (NPCs)

**What they are:**
- Federally mandated tools on every college's website that estimate a family's actual out-of-pocket cost after grants and scholarships
- You input family income, assets, household size, and sometimes academic stats, and the calculator returns an estimated net price

**Why families MUST run them before applying:**
- Sticker price is misleading. A school with a $90K sticker price might cost a family $15K/year after aid, while a school with a $30K sticker price might cost $28K/year after minimal aid.
- NPCs are the single best tool for comparing affordability across schools before application season. Run the NPC at every school on the list.
- For schools that meet 100% of need, the NPC is usually quite accurate.
- For schools that don't meet full need, the NPC may be optimistic (actual aid could be less).

**Limitations:**
- Accuracy depends on the quality of financial information entered
- Some NPCs are better than others. MyinTuition (used by many top schools) is quick but less precise. Full institutional NPCs are more accurate.
- NPCs reflect current-year policies; they may change by enrollment time
- They do not account for merit scholarships at most schools (only need-based aid)

**Key advice:** Run NPCs at every school on the family's list during junior year, before finalizing the college list. If a school's NPC shows a net cost the family cannot afford, it should not be on the list unless the student has a strong shot at merit aid or the family has a plan to bridge the gap.

## 6. Need-Blind vs. Need-Aware Admissions

**Need-blind:**
- The admissions office does not see or consider an applicant's financial situation when making admit/deny decisions
- Approximately 100 U.S. colleges practice need-blind admissions for domestic students
- Being need-blind does NOT mean the school meets full need. Many need-blind schools admit you without considering your finances, then give you an aid package that doesn't cover everything (gapping).
- The most generous combination is need-blind + meets 100% of need (e.g., all Ivies, Stanford, MIT, Amherst, Williams)

**Need-aware (also called need-sensitive):**
- The admissions office may consider your ability to pay as a factor in the admissions decision
- This most commonly affects borderline applicants. Schools typically admit most of their class need-blind and become need-aware for the final pool of candidates.
- Being need-aware does NOT mean low-income students are shut out. Many need-aware schools offer strong aid because they can budget precisely.
- Some need-aware schools actually provide better average aid packages than need-blind schools because they can match resources to commitments.

**International students:**
- Almost all U.S. colleges are need-aware for international applicants, even if they are need-blind for domestic students
- Only a handful of schools are need-blind for international students: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, and Dartmouth (this list is small and may change; verify current policies)

**Key implication for families:** Do not avoid a school solely because it is need-aware. The actual financial aid offer matters more than the admissions policy label. However, at need-aware schools, a full-pay applicant may have a marginal admissions advantage over an equally qualified applicant who needs significant aid.

## 7. QuestBridge

**What it is:**
- A nonprofit that connects high-achieving, low-income students with full four-year scholarships at top colleges through the National College Match program
- Matched students receive a binding commitment: full cost of attendance (tuition, room, board, books, travel) for four years with no loans

**Eligibility (guidelines, not hard cutoffs):**
- Household income typically under $65,000 for a family of four (scales with family size, e.g., ~$75K for a family of six)
- Minimal assets
- Strong academic record (no minimum GPA/test score, but finalists typically have very strong profiles)
- QuestBridge reviews holistically; there are no absolute income cutoffs, but the program is designed for students from low-income backgrounds

**How it works:**
1. Students apply to QuestBridge (separate from college applications) in early fall of senior year
2. Finalists rank up to 12 partner colleges
3. Partner colleges review Finalist applications and "match" students in December
4. A Match is binding: the student enrolls at that school with a full scholarship
5. Students who are not matched as Finalists can still apply to partner schools through Regular Decision using their QuestBridge application (called QuestBridge Regular Decision)

**Number of partner schools:** 55 colleges as of 2025, including:
- Research universities: Brown, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Northwestern, Notre Dame, Penn, Princeton, Rice, Stanford, UChicago, UVA, Vanderbilt, WashU, Yale
- Liberal arts colleges: Amherst, Bates, Bowdoin, Carleton, Claremont McKenna, Colby, Colgate, Colorado College, Davidson, Denison, Grinnell, Hamilton, Haverford, Macalester, Middlebury, Oberlin, Pomona, Scripps, Smith, Swarthmore, Trinity, Tufts, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Williams
- Others: USC, University of Richmond, and more

**Key implication for families:** QuestBridge is one of the most powerful financial aid pathways in the country for families who qualify. If a family's income is under ~$65K and the student is high-achieving, they should be applying through QuestBridge. The Match is binding, so students should only rank schools where they would genuinely enroll.

## 8. Gapping

**What it is:**
- "Gapping" occurs when a college admits a student but provides a financial aid package that does NOT cover the full gap between the cost of attendance and the family's ability to pay
- The student is left with an unfunded shortfall (the "gap") that the family must cover through additional borrowing, out-of-pocket payments, or outside scholarships

**How common it is:**
- Extremely common. The vast majority of U.S. colleges gap their students. Only ~70-75 schools commit to meeting 100% of demonstrated need (see Section 3).
- Gaps of $5,000-$15,000 per year are common at mid-tier private schools and some public universities
- Some families receive gaps of $20,000+ per year

**Why it happens:**
- Most colleges do not have the endowment to fully fund every admitted student's need
- Some schools use "admit-deny" strategy: they admit the student but offer an aid package so inadequate that the student effectively cannot afford to attend
- Need-aware schools may manage enrollment by offering less aid to students who are less likely to enroll or less desirable to the institution

**Key implications for families:**
- Always compare the NET cost (after all aid) across schools, not just the sticker price or the "total aid" number
- A school that meets 100% of need at a $90K sticker price may be cheaper than a school with a $40K sticker price that gaps you $15K/year
- If a family receives a gapped offer, they can: (1) appeal the aid package with documentation, (2) use a competing offer from a peer institution as leverage, (3) decline the offer
- Financial aid appeals work best when you have new information (job loss, medical bills, competing offer) and when you approach the conversation respectfully as a negotiation, not a complaint

## 9. Demonstrated Interest

**What it is:**
- Some colleges track how much interest an applicant shows in their school (campus visits, email opens, event attendance, webinar participation, social media engagement, direct communication with admissions) and use it as a factor in admissions decisions

**Schools that typically track and value demonstrated interest:**
- Mid-tier private universities and smaller private colleges: Tulane (marks it "important"), Boston University, Lehigh, Case Western, University of Miami, Villanova, Wake Forest, American University, GWU, Northeastern
- Some selective schools: Duke considers it in their process
- Many LACs in the 30-60 ranking range actively track it

**Schools that generally do NOT track demonstrated interest:**
- All Ivy League schools (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.)
- Stanford, MIT, Caltech
- Large public universities (UC system, Big Ten, etc.)
- Schools with very high application volumes that assume interest

**How to check:**
- Every accredited U.S. college publishes a Common Data Set (CDS). Search "[School Name] Common Data Set" and look at section C7 for "Level of applicant's interest" -- it will say "Not Considered," "Considered," "Important," or "Very Important."
- Many colleges use CRM systems (like Slate) to track email opens, click-throughs, webinar attendance, and time spent on virtual tour pages

**Key implication for families:**
- At schools that track demonstrated interest, students should: visit campus (or attend virtual events if visiting is not possible), open admissions emails, attend regional information sessions, sign up for the mailing list, and ideally make direct contact with the regional admissions officer
- At schools that don't track it (Ivies, Stanford, MIT), these actions don't help the application but can still help the student make a more informed decision
- Applying Early Decision is the strongest possible signal of demonstrated interest at any school that offers it

## 10. Test-Optional Policies (2025-2026 Landscape)

**The trend is reversing.** After the COVID-era expansion of test-optional policies, a significant number of selective schools have reinstated standardized testing requirements beginning with the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 admissions cycles.

**Schools that NOW REQUIRE standardized tests (as of 2025-26 applications):**
- Harvard
- Yale (test-flexible: accepts SAT, ACT, AP, or IB scores)
- Brown
- Dartmouth
- MIT
- Caltech
- UPenn (announced return)
- Cornell (required starting fall 2026 enrollment)
- Stanford (required starting fall 2026 enrollment)
- Georgetown (always required tests; never went test-optional)
- Carnegie Mellon
- University of Florida
- Georgia Tech, Georgia (public flagships reinstating)

**Schools remaining test-optional (for now, as of 2025-26):**
- Columbia (permanently test-optional, the only Ivy)
- Princeton (test-optional through fall 2026 enrollment; will require tests starting 2027-28 cycle)
- University of Chicago
- NYU
- Most UC system schools (test-free for California residents under UC policy)
- Many liberal arts colleges remain test-optional

**Broader landscape:**
- Over 80% of all U.S. four-year colleges remain test-optional, but this includes many non-selective schools where testing matters less
- Among the most selective 50-100 schools, the trend is clearly moving back toward requiring tests
- Research cited by schools reinstating tests (including Opportunity Insights / Harvard study) found standardized tests are a stronger predictor of college success than high school GPA alone, particularly for students from under-resourced schools

**Key implications for families:**
- Even at test-optional schools, submitting strong scores helps. Data consistently shows that applicants who submit scores (when strong) are admitted at higher rates than those who don't.
- "Test-optional" does not mean "test-blind." Admissions officers at test-optional schools do see scores when submitted and consider them. Only a few schools (e.g., some UCs for in-state) are truly test-blind.
- If a student's scores are at or above a school's 25th percentile, they should generally submit. If scores are below the 25th percentile, going test-optional is usually the better strategy.
- The safest approach in 2025-26: prepare for and take the SAT or ACT. This keeps all doors open, including schools that now require scores. Decide school-by-school whether to submit.

## Usage Notes for Prompt Injection

When generating a college strategy for a family, use these facts to:

1. **Build accurate school lists.** Do not recommend a no-merit school as a "financial safety" for a family that won't qualify for need-based aid. Do not assume a family can afford sticker price without checking.
2. **Flag NPC usage.** Always recommend the family run Net Price Calculators at every school on the list. If the family hasn't done this, flag it as an urgent action item.
3. **Identify QuestBridge eligibility.** If household income is under ~$65K, QuestBridge should be prominently discussed.
4. **Distinguish between "generous" and "affordable."** A school that meets 100% of need is generous but may still cost a family $40K/year if the EFC is high. A state flagship with merit aid might cost $5K/year. "Generous" and "cheapest option" are different.
5. **Be precise about merit vs. need.** Never tell a family they'll "get scholarships" at an Ivy. Ivies do not give merit scholarships. The aid they give is need-based.
6. **Account for testing requirements.** If a student is applying test-optional, note which schools on their list require tests and plan accordingly.
7. **Flag CSS Profile requirements.** If a school requires the CSS Profile, the family needs to plan for that (it's more detailed, costs money, and may require non-custodial parent information for divorced families).
8. **Warn about gapping.** If a school does NOT appear on the "meets 100% of need" list, the family should expect that the aid offer may leave a gap. Build this into the financial model.
