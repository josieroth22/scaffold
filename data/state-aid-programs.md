## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This reference is organized into five sections:

1. **Merit-Based Scholarships** -- Programs with specific GPA and test score thresholds. These are the best "financial floor" candidates because families can plan around hitting concrete numbers years in advance.
2. **Automatic Admission Rules** -- State laws guaranteeing admission based on class rank (Texas, California).
3. **State 4-Year Financial Aid Programs** -- Need-based, merit-based, and hybrid programs covering tuition at 4-year institutions. Organized alphabetically within the section.
4. **Community College Promise Programs** -- State programs covering 2-year tuition. Listed alphabetically.
5. **Regional & Unique Programs** -- DC TAG, WUE, MSEP, and other cross-state programs.

Each program entry includes eligibility requirements, what it covers, and a **Scaffold note** explaining how the AI prompt should use the information when generating a family's plan.

At the bottom, **Notes for the Scaffold Prompt** provides 17 rules for how the AI should handle state aid across all plans.

## 1. MERIT-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS

These programs have clear, published academic thresholds. Families can plan around hitting these numbers years in advance, making them ideal for Scaffold's developmental roadmap.

---

### GEORGIA -- HOPE Scholarship & Zell Miller Scholarship

**HOPE Scholarship**
- Requirements: 3.0 GPA (as calculated by Georgia Student Finance Commission), Georgia resident, graduate from eligible GA high school
- Covers: Partial tuition at Georgia public colleges and universities
- Renewal: 3.0 cumulative GPA in college, checked at 30/60/90 attempted hours and end of each spring semester
- Duration: Up to 127 semester hours or first bachelor's degree

**Zell Miller Scholarship**
- Requirements: 3.7 GPA + 1200 SAT (math + reading) OR 25 ACT composite, from a single sitting. Also requires four rigor courses (AP, IB, or dual enrollment). Valedictorians and salutatorians automatically qualify.
- Covers: 100% of tuition at Georgia public colleges and universities. At Georgia Tech, that's roughly $10,500/year for two semesters at 15 credit hours.
- Renewal: 3.3 cumulative GPA in college
- Duration: Up to 127 semester hours, 10-year eligibility window
- Key detail: If you lose Zell Miller but maintain 3.0, you drop to HOPE. Can regain Zell Miller one time at a checkpoint.
- STEM boost: 0.5 GPA points added for B/C/D grades in approved STEM courses

**Scaffold note:** Zell Miller is one of the strongest "financial floor" programs in the country. For any Georgia family, the plan should explicitly identify "protect the 3.7 GPA and get to 1200 SAT" as the single most important financial move.

---

### FLORIDA -- Bright Futures Scholarship Program

**Florida Academic Scholars (FAS)**
- Requirements: 3.5 weighted GPA in 16 college-prep core courses, 1330 SAT or 29 ACT (Class of 2026+), 100 hours of community service or paid work (75 service hours for students entering 9th grade in 2024-25 and beyond)
- Covers: 100% of tuition and applicable fees at Florida public institutions, plus $300/semester for additional costs. Comparable award at private Florida schools.
- Note: Test score thresholds change by graduating class.

**Florida Medallion Scholars (FMS)**
- Requirements: 3.0 weighted GPA in core courses, 1190 SAT or 24 ACT (Class of 2026+), 75 service hours or 100 paid work hours or 100 combined
- Covers: 75% of tuition and applicable fees at Florida public institutions

**Florida Gold Seal CAPE Scholars**
- Requirements: 3.0 weighted core GPA + 3.5 GPA in 3 years of the same vocational program
- Covers: Fixed per-credit-hour amount for career and technical programs

**General Bright Futures rules:**
- Florida resident and US citizen or eligible noncitizen
- Must graduate from a Florida high school
- Apply via the Florida Financial Aid Application (FFAA) by August 31 after graduation
- Available at Florida public and qualifying private institutions only
- Minimum 6 credits per semester to receive funding
- Renewal requirements vary by tier

**Scaffold note:** FAS is Florida's equivalent of Georgia's Zell Miller. The plan should build the course selection strategy around hitting the GPA and test score thresholds. The community service/work hours requirement is easy to miss and should be flagged early, starting freshman year of high school.

---

### LOUISIANA -- TOPS (Taylor Opportunity Program for Students)

Five award levels, from least to most competitive:

**TOPS Tech:** 2.5 core GPA + ACT 17 (or Silver level WorkKeys) + 21 TOPS Tech Jumpstart Core Curriculum units. Covers tuition at 2-year Louisiana public institutions.

**TOPS Opportunity:** 2.5 core GPA + ACT 20 + 19 TOPS Core Curriculum units. Covers tuition at Louisiana public institutions.

**TOPS Performance:** 3.25 core GPA (Class of 2022+) + ACT 23. Covers tuition + $400/year stipend.

**TOPS Honors:** 3.5 core GPA + ACT 27. Covers tuition + $800/year stipend.

**TOPS Excellence (NEW, added 2025):** 3.5 core GPA + ACT 31. Covers full tuition and fees or $12,000/year, whichever is less. At private LAICU institutions: tuition and fees or $8,500/year.

**General TOPS rules:**
- Louisiana resident (parents too) for at least 2 years prior to July 1 of enrollment year
- Must attend a BESE-approved high school (all LA public schools qualify; private schools must be approved)
- Must enroll full-time by the first semester following the first anniversary of high school graduation
- TOPS does NOT superscore ACT/SAT. Highest composite from a single sitting is used.
- The Opportunity tier ACT minimum is the prior year's state average, but never less than 20
- Renewal: Full-time enrollment, earn 24 credits/year, maintain 2.0 cumulative GPA. Performance, Honors, and Excellence require 3.0 cumulative, checked at end of each spring.
- Now accepts the Classical Learning Test (CLT) in addition to ACT and SAT

**Scaffold note:** TOPS has a lower floor than most state merit programs (ACT 17 for Tech, ACT 20 for Opportunity), making it accessible to a wide range of students. The tiered structure means the plan can show families exactly what each ACT score improvement is worth in dollars. The new Excellence tier is a big deal for high-achieving Louisiana students.

### SOUTH CAROLINA -- Palmetto Fellows, LIFE, and HOPE

**Palmetto Fellows Scholarship**
- Standard path: Top 6% class rank + 1200 SAT or 25 ACT + 3.5 cumulative GPA on SC Uniform Grading Policy
- Alternate path (no rank required): 1400 SAT or 31 ACT + 4.0 cumulative GPA
- Award: $6,700 freshman year, $7,500 sophomore through senior years
- STEM Enhancement: Additional $2,500/year for STEM majors starting sophomore year (must complete 14 credits of math/science by end of first year)
- Renewal: 3.0 cumulative GPA, 30 credit hours per year
- Must attend an eligible SC four-year institution
- SAT superscoring allowed. ACT composite from multiple sittings allowed.

**SC LIFE Scholarship**
- Requirements: Two of the following three: 3.0 GPA on SC Uniform Grading Policy, 1100 SAT or 22 ACT (effective Fall 2023+), top 30% of class
- Award: Up to $5,000/year ($4,700 tuition + $300 books) at four-year institutions
- Cannot receive both Palmetto Fellows and LIFE in the same year

**SC HOPE Scholarship**
- Requirements: 3.0 GPA (for students who don't qualify for LIFE)
- Award: Up to $2,800 freshman year only. Non-renewable.

**Scaffold note:** South Carolina has a three-tier system. The plan should identify which tier the student is most likely to hit and what it would take to reach the next one. The STEM enhancement for Palmetto Fellows ($2,500/year extra) is worth noting for any STEM-inclined student.

---

### TENNESSEE -- HOPE Scholarship & Related Programs

**Tennessee HOPE Scholarship**
- Requirements: 3.0 GPA or 21 ACT / 1060 SAT, Tennessee resident
- Award at 4-year institutions: $2,250/semester ($4,500/year) for freshmen and sophomores, $2,850/semester ($5,700/year) for juniors and seniors
- Award at 2-year institutions: $1,500/semester ($3,000/year)
- Renewal: Continuous enrollment, 2.75 cumulative GPA at 24 and 48 attempted hours, 3.0 GPA at 72/96/120 hours

**Tennessee HOPE Access Grant**
- Requirements: 2.75 GPA, 18-20 ACT, household AGI $36,000 or less
- Award: $2,650/year at 4-year institutions, $1,700/year at 2-year institutions (freshman and sophomore years only)

**Aspire Award (supplement to HOPE)**
- For HOPE-eligible students with household AGI of $36,000 or less
- Additional $500/semester ($1,000/year) at 4-year institutions, $250/semester at 2-year institutions

**General Assist Award**
- Tennessee resident with financial need, enrolled at least half-time
- Up to $2,000/year

**Scaffold note:** Tennessee's HOPE is less generous than Georgia's but still significant. The plan should pair it with Tennessee Promise (see community college section) for families considering a 2-year start.

---

### KENTUCKY -- Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES)

KEES is unusual: it accumulates year by year through high school based on each year's GPA, with a bonus added for ACT scores.

- GPA awards: 2.5 GPA earns $125/year, scaling up to $500/year for 4.0. Each year of high school is calculated separately.
- ACT bonus: 15 ACT earns $36, scaling up to $500 for 28+
- AP/IB supplemental awards available for low-income students (free/reduced lunch eligible)
- Maximum possible award: roughly $2,500/year (combining all four years of GPA awards + ACT bonus)
- Covers: Annual award at any Kentucky college or university
- Renewal: 3.0+ GPA gets full award. 2.5-2.99 may receive reduced award depending on "on track to graduate" status. Below 2.5 loses the award for the following year.
- Duration: 8 semesters or 5 years from high school graduation, whichever comes first

**Scaffold note:** Because KEES accumulates year by year, the plan should show families the cumulative value of maintaining high grades each year, not just senior year. A student who earns a 4.0 every year of high school and scores 28+ on the ACT locks in $2,500/year for college without filing a single application.

---

### WYOMING -- Hathaway Scholarship

Wyoming's only state scholarship program. Four merit-based tiers for graduates attending Wyoming community colleges or the University of Wyoming:

| Tier | GPA | ACT | Per Semester |
|------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Honors | 3.5 | 25 | $1,680 |
| Performance | 3.0 | 21 | $1,260 |
| Opportunity | 2.5 | 19 | $840 |
| Provisional | 2.5 | 17 | $840 (community college only) |

- Must complete the Hathaway Success Curriculum (4 years each of math, English, science; 3 years social studies; 4 years of foreign language, arts, or CTE)
- ACT superscoring is allowed
- Renewal: 2.5 GPA for Honors/Performance/Opportunity (if GPA drops below 2.5 but stays above 2.25, student drops to Opportunity level). 2.25 GPA for Provisional.
- Duration: 8 full-time semesters (96 credits) over 6 years
- Need-based supplement available if unmet need exceeds $2,000 (requires FAFSA)
- Must initiate within 4 years of high school graduation
- Provisional students can transfer from community college to UW after earning an associate degree

**Scaffold note:** Because Hathaway is Wyoming's entire state financial aid conversation, the plan should spell out exactly what each GPA/ACT improvement is worth in dollars. For Provisional students, the community college path to UW is a built-in feature of the program, not a workaround.

---

### WEST VIRGINIA -- PROMISE Scholarship

- Requirements: 3.0 core GPA + 22 ACT composite (with sub-scores of 20+ in each section) or equivalent SAT
- Covers: Full tuition and mandatory fees at WV public institutions, comparable amount at private WV institutions
- Renewal: 2.75 GPA + 30 credits/year in the first year, 3.0 GPA thereafter

**Scaffold note:** PROMISE is West Virginia's flagship merit scholarship and covers full tuition, making it the most important financial target for WV families. The ACT sub-score requirement (20+ in each section) is easy to overlook. A student with a 24 composite but a 19 in one section would not qualify. The plan should flag both the composite and sub-score targets.

---

### MISSISSIPPI -- Eminent Scholars Grant, MTAG, and MESG

**Eminent Scholars Grant:** 3.5 GPA + 29 ACT. Covers full tuition at Mississippi public institutions.

**MTAG (Tuition Assistance Grant):** 2.5 GPA + 15 ACT (public schools) or 2.5 GPA (private schools). Award varies by institution type.

**MESG (Education Scholars Grant):** 3.5 GPA + 29 ACT. Covers up to full tuition equivalent at private Mississippi institutions.

**Scaffold note:** Mississippi has a two-track system: the Eminent Scholars Grant and MESG target high achievers (3.5 GPA + 29 ACT) at public and private schools respectively, while MTAG provides a lower-threshold option (2.5 GPA + 15 ACT). For families with strong students, the 29 ACT target is worth building toward. For others, MTAG ensures some state support is available at a much lower bar.

---

### ALASKA -- Performance Scholarship

Three tiers. Level I: 3.5 GPA + 25 ACT. Level II: 3.0 GPA + 23 ACT. Level III: 2.5 GPA + 20 ACT. Awards up to $4,755/year (Level I) at Alaska institutions. Must complete specific core curriculum.

**Scaffold note:** Alaska's tiered structure means the plan should show families exactly what each GPA/ACT improvement unlocks. The required core curriculum must be planned early in high school. Because Alaska has limited in-state college options, the plan should also flag WUE eligibility for students considering schools in other western states.

---

## 2. AUTOMATIC ADMISSION RULES

---

### TEXAS -- Top % Rule

**At all Texas public universities:** Top 10% of graduating class = guaranteed admission.

**At UT Austin (special rules):**
- Fall 2025 / spring 2026 applicants: Top 6%
- Fall 2026 and beyond: Top 5%
- By law, 75% of UT Austin's in-state freshman seats must go to auto-admitted students
- Important: Auto-admit guarantees a SEAT, not a specific MAJOR. Competitive programs (engineering, business, CS, nursing) run their own selection.
- For Texas A&M: Top 10% still applies

**Scaffold note:** For Texas families, class rank is everything. The plan should explain the competitive dynamics of the student's specific high school (rank is relative to peers, so a 4.0 at one school might be top 3% and at another might be top 15%). The plan should also be clear that auto-admit to UT doesn't mean auto-admit to McCombs or Cockrell.

---

### CALIFORNIA -- UC Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC)

- Top 9% of each California high school's graduating class is identified and guaranteed admission to at least one UC campus (not necessarily their first choice)
- Based on GPA in UC-required coursework (a-g courses)
- Separate from general UC admission, which uses holistic review

---

## 3. STATE 4-YEAR FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS

---

### NEW YORK -- Excelsior Scholarship

- Income limit: $125,000 household AGI or less
- Covers: Tuition-free at SUNY or CUNY (2-year and 4-year), last-dollar after Pell and TAP
- Requirements: 30 credits/year, continuous full-time enrollment
- Post-graduation obligation: Must live and work in NY for a number of years equal to years of scholarship received. If you leave, it converts to a no-interest loan.
- Timeline: 5 years to complete bachelor's, 3 for associate's

**Scaffold note:** The residency/work requirement is a real constraint. The plan should flag this explicitly for any NY family considering Excelsior. A student who receives Excelsior for four years owes four years of living and working in New York.

---

### NEW MEXICO -- Opportunity Scholarship

- No income cap. No separate application required (automatically awarded by the institution).
- Covers: Tuition and fees at all 29 NM public colleges and four-year universities
- Requirements: NM resident 12+ months, 2.5 GPA in college, at least 6 credits/semester (12 for recent high school graduates in their first term)
- Recent graduates must enroll within 16 months of graduation, complete 30 credits/year at 4-year institutions or 24 credits/year at 2-year institutions
- Returning learners must enroll in 6+ credits
- Duration: Up to 160 attempted credit hours for bachelor's, 90 for associate's

**Scaffold note:** For NM families, this is one of the best financial floors in the country. No income limit, no application, covers four-year schools. The plan should model what attending UNM or NMSU looks like with Opportunity covering tuition, layered with Pell for other costs.

---

### INDIANA -- 21st Century Scholars

- Must enroll in 7th or 8th grade. Auto-enrolled for income-eligible students in the classes of 2028 and beyond.
- Initial income threshold: Based on free/reduced lunch eligibility, roughly 185% of Federal Poverty Level (about $59,000 for a family of four; adjusts annually)
- College-entry financial means test: 400% of FPL (roughly $127,000 for a family of four for the Class of 2025; varies by family size and year)
- Scholar Pledge: Graduate with Core 40 diploma, 2.5+ GPA, complete Scholar Success Program activities, no felonies or drug use
- Covers: Up to 100% of tuition at Indiana public colleges and universities, comparable award at private Indiana schools
- Duration: Up to 4 years
- Must complete 30 credits/year in college

**Scaffold note:** This is a critical "early action" program. For Indiana families with kids in 6th or 7th grade, the plan MUST flag this. Missing the 8th grade enrollment deadline means missing the scholarship entirely. With automatic enrollment now in effect for recent classes, the plan should tell families to check ScholarTrack.IN.gov to confirm enrollment.

---

### OKLAHOMA -- Oklahoma's Promise

- Apply: 8th through 12th grade (deadline December 31 of senior year, but earlier is better)
- Income limit at application: $60,000 AGI (1-2 dependent children), $70,000 (3-4 children), $80,000 (5+ children)
- Income limit in college: $100,000 AGI, checked annually via FAFSA
- High school requirements: Complete 15-unit college-prep core curriculum (or 17 units for full college admission eligibility, which adds foreign language and fine arts), 2.5 cumulative GPA in those courses AND overall, no felonies or drug abuse
- Covers: Full tuition at any Oklahoma public college or university, or partial tuition at accredited Oklahoma private colleges and career technology centers
- Duration: Up to 5 years or 129 credit hours or bachelor's degree, whichever comes first
- Special provision: Children of Oklahoma public school teachers with 10+ years of service have expanded income eligibility (700% of Federal Poverty Level)

**Scaffold note:** Oklahoma's Promise is one of the best "early commitment" programs in the country. For Oklahoma families with kids in middle school, this should be flagged immediately. The income check happens TWICE: once at application (lower thresholds) and again each year in college ($100K cap). Families whose income might rise should apply early while they still qualify.

---

### WASHINGTON -- Washington College Grant

One of the most generous need-based programs in the country. Replaced the old State Need Grant in 2019.

- Income thresholds (family of four, 2025-26):
  - Full award (covers 100% of tuition): Household income at or below roughly $78,500 (60% of state median family income)
  - Partial awards: Available up to roughly $131,000 (100% of state MFI)
  - Awards decrease on a sliding scale as income rises
- Maximum award: Up to roughly $12,780/year at UW (varies by institution type)
- Works at all Washington public 2-year and 4-year institutions, many private institutions, and state-registered apprenticeship programs
- No GPA or test score requirement
- Must file FAFSA or WASFA (for undocumented students)
- Guaranteed funding for all eligible students (no waitlist since 2020)

**Scaffold note:** WA Grant can cover full tuition at UW for families under roughly $78K and provides meaningful partial awards well into the middle class ($131K). Unlike many state programs, there's no merit component at all. The plan should model cost of attendance at UW or WSU with WA Grant applied.

---

### TEXAS -- TEXAS Grant (Toward EXcellence, Access, and Success)

- Requirements: Texas resident, demonstrated financial need (FAFSA required), enrolled at a Texas public university, must not have attempted more than 30 semester credit hours at time of initial award (excluding dual enrollment and credit-by-exam hours), no felony drug convictions
- Award: Up to $10,858/year at universities ($5,429/semester maximum for 2025-26; varies by institution based on cost of attendance and available funding). Target award is $5,000/year ($2,500/semester).
- Renewal: Must complete at least 24 semester credit hours per year, maintain 75% course completion rate and 2.5 cumulative GPA (checked at end of second year and each subsequent year). First-year students must meet institutional satisfactory academic progress standards.
- Duration: Up to 150 attempted semester credit hours or receipt of a bachelor's degree, whichever comes first
- Key details: Available only at Texas public universities (not community colleges, which have TEOG instead). Students must enroll within 16 months of high school graduation. Priority consideration given to students with SAI at or below roughly $6,500. The grant is need-based with no merit component.
- Note: For Texas automatic admission rules (Top 10% / Top 6% at UT Austin), see Section 2.

**Scaffold note:** For Texas families with financial need, the TEXAS Grant combined with the Top % auto-admit rule (Section 2) creates one of the most powerful state-level combos in the country. A student who ranks in the top 6-10% of their class gets guaranteed admission to a Texas public university, and if the family qualifies financially, the TEXAS Grant can cover a large share of tuition on top of that. The plan should model UT Austin or Texas A&M with TEXAS Grant + Pell layered together. Flag the 16-month enrollment window and the 30-credit-hour cap for initial eligibility, since dual enrollment credits (excluded from the cap) will not disqualify the student.

---

### CALIFORNIA -- Cal Grant

- Cal Grant A: Need-based + 3.0 GPA minimum. Covers tuition at UC (up to roughly $14,000/year), CSU (roughly $5,742/year), or private schools (up to $9,220/year).
- Cal Grant B: Need-based + 2.0 GPA minimum. First year covers living allowance only (roughly $1,648); subsequent years add tuition like Cal Grant A.
- Cal Grant C: For vocational and technical students. Covers books, supplies, and tuition at private schools.
- Competitive Cal Grants: Roughly 11,000 awarded annually to students who don't qualify for entitlement grants.
- Deadline: March 2 each year (FAFSA + GPA verification)

**California Middle Class Scholarship:** For families with income up to $234,000 (2025-26; adjusts annually). Award varies by student based on cost of attendance minus other aid. Available at UC, CSU, and select community college bachelor's programs.

---

### ARKANSAS -- Academic Challenge Scholarship & ArFuture Grant

**Academic Challenge Scholarship**
- Requirements: ACT 19 (or equivalent), Arkansas resident 12+ months, pursuing first bachelor's
- Award at 4-year institutions: $1,000 freshman year, $4,000 sophomore and junior years, $5,000 senior year
- Award at 2-year institutions: $1,000 first year, $3,000 second year
- Additional "PLUS" funding: Up to $2,500/semester for students with SAI below 8,000
- Renewal: 2.5 GPA, earn 27 credits first year then 30 credits/year after
- Apply by July 1 of senior year via SAMS (sams.adhe.edu)
- Funded by the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery

**ArFuture Grant**
- Covers tuition and fees for certificate and associate degree programs at Arkansas public institutions
- Must enroll in STEM or designated high-demand program
- No GPA or test score requirement beyond high school graduation

**Governor's Distinguished Scholarship:** Up to $5,000/year for top academic performers. Can be combined with Academic Challenge (total cannot exceed $10,000/year).

**Scaffold note:** Arkansas has a layered system. The Academic Challenge is the workhorse program (ACT 19 is a relatively low bar), and ArFuture fills the gap for community college and career-tech paths. The escalating award structure ($1K to $5K) rewards persistence.

---

### ILLINOIS -- Monetary Award Program (MAP Grant)

- Need-based. No GPA or test score requirement.
- Maximum award: Up to $8,064/year (2025-26; statutory max is $8,400 before a 4% reduction factor)
- Must have SAI (Student Aid Index) of 9,000 or less
- Must be Illinois resident, enrolled at least 3 credit hours (awards are prorated; full award at 15+ credits)
- Must file FAFSA by the suspension date (typically early spring; funds run out, so apply EARLY)
- Available at approved Illinois public and private 2-year and 4-year colleges
- Maximum of 135 MAP Paid Credit Hours total
- Funded by Illinois General Assembly (roughly $722 million for 2025-26)
- Undocumented students can apply via the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid (under the RISE Act)

**Scaffold note:** MAP is purely need-based and substantial ($8K/year), but funding is first-come-first-served and routinely runs out. The plan should emphasize filing the FAFSA as early as possible. For Illinois families, combining MAP with Pell can make community college or a state university very affordable.

---

### IDAHO -- Opportunity Scholarship & LAUNCH

**Idaho Opportunity Scholarship**
- Requirements: 2.7 unweighted GPA, Idaho resident, graduated from Idaho high school or equivalent
- Award: Up to $3,500/year, renewable for up to 4 years ($14,000 total)
- Scoring: 70% based on SAI (from FAFSA), 30% based on GPA
- FAFSA deadline: March 1
- Renewal: 2.7 GPA in college, 30 credits/year, satisfactory academic progress
- Available at eligible Idaho colleges and universities (note: community colleges are no longer eligible for new recipients as of 2023-24)

**Idaho LAUNCH**
- One-time grant covering up to 80% of tuition and fees, max $8,000
- For Idaho high school graduates pursuing in-demand career programs
- Roughly $75 million in funding, 9,000-10,000 awards per year
- Priority application deadline: November 30
- Cannot receive both LAUNCH and Opportunity Scholarship simultaneously

**Scaffold note:** Idaho families need to choose between Opportunity (renewable, smaller annual amount) and LAUNCH (one-time, larger amount). For students headed to 4-year universities, Opportunity is usually better over time. For career-tech certificates, LAUNCH may be the better fit.

### MICHIGAN -- Reconnect & Achievement Scholarship

**Michigan Reconnect**
- Free in-district tuition at Michigan community colleges for adults 25+
- Michigan resident 1+ year, high school diploma or GED, no prior college degree
- Last-dollar scholarship (Pell applied first). Must earn 12 credits/year and maintain 2.0 GPA.

**Michigan Achievement Scholarship / Community College Guarantee**
- Tuition-free community college for recent high school graduates

**Scaffold note:** Reconnect is primarily for adults returning to school, so it's less relevant for Scaffold's typical K-12 audience. The Michigan Achievement Scholarship for recent graduates IS relevant and should be flagged for Michigan families considering a community college start.

### NORTH CAROLINA -- Next NC Scholarship & NC Promise

**Next NC Scholarship (replaces NC Education Lottery Scholarship, starting 2024-25)**
- Combines Pell Grant with state-funded financial aid into one package
- At UNC System universities: At least $5,000/year for eligible students
- At NC community colleges: At least $3,000/year
- Eligibility: NC resident, financial need (approximately AGI under $80,000, tied to SAI)
- Can cover tuition, fees, books, food, and housing
- Must file FAFSA (priority deadline: June 1 for UNC System, August 15 for community colleges)

**NC Promise Tuition Plan**
- Reduces tuition to $500/semester for ALL undergraduates (no eligibility requirements) at four UNC System schools:
  - Elizabeth City State University
  - Fayetteville State University
  - University of North Carolina at Pembroke
  - Western Carolina University
- Out-of-state: $3,500/semester (for students entering fall 2026 and beyond; $2,500 for continuing students)
- No application required. All undergraduates automatically receive the rate.
- Has driven 62% enrollment increase at Elizabeth City State since launch.

**Scaffold note:** NC Promise is extraordinary. $500/semester tuition at a 4-year university with no eligibility requirements. For NC families near these four campuses, the plan should model full cost of attendance (tuition is $1,000/year but room, board, and fees are separate). Combined with Next NC Scholarship or Pell, the total cost can approach zero for low-income families.

### MINNESOTA -- North Star Promise Scholarship

- Income limit: $80,000 household AGI (dependent students: student + parent/stepparent AGI; independent students: student + spouse AGI)
- Covers: Tuition and mandatory fees on a last-dollar basis at ALL Minnesota public institutions: Minnesota State universities, University of Minnesota campuses, state community/technical colleges, and Tribal Colleges. Private institutions are NOT eligible.
- Requirements: Minnesota resident, enrolled in a degree/diploma/certificate program, must complete FAFSA or Minnesota Dream Act Application by the 30th day of the term, maintain satisfactory academic progress. No minimum GPA beyond SAP. No separate application.
- Duration: Up to 8 full-time semesters (or 120 credits) for bachelor's students; up to 4 semesters (or 60 credits) for associate's students
- Key details: This is NOT just a community college program. It covers 4-year universities including all University of Minnesota campuses. Last-dollar means other scholarships reduce the North Star award rather than stacking on top. Both new and returning students are eligible. Students who already hold a bachelor's degree are not eligible.

**Scaffold note:** North Star Promise is effectively free tuition at any public college or university in Minnesota for families under $80K. This is one of the most comprehensive state programs in the country. The plan should model UMN Twin Cities or a Minnesota State university with North Star covering tuition, then layer Pell for remaining costs. Note: because it's last-dollar, institutional merit scholarships won't reduce the family's out-of-pocket, they'll just reduce the North Star amount.

### NEW JERSEY -- Tuition Aid Grant (TAG)

- Requirements: NJ resident 12+ months, US citizen or eligible noncitizen (or eligible for NJ Alternative Financial Aid Application), enrolled at least half-time (6+ credits) at an approved NJ institution. Must demonstrate financial need via the NJ Eligibility Index (NJEI), calculated from FAFSA data, which must fall between 0 and 7,500. No separate application, just file FAFSA or NJ Alternative Application by state deadline.
- Covers (2025-26 maximum awards by institution type):
  - County colleges (2-year): up to $3,098
  - State colleges and universities: up to $9,496
  - Public research universities (Rutgers, NJIT): up to $10,964
  - Private nonprofit colleges: up to $14,404
  - Part-time (6-8 credits): up to $774; three-quarter time (9-11 credits): up to $1,161
- Renewal: Annual FAFSA, maintain satisfactory academic progress
- Duration: Up to 9 semesters for bachelor's, 5 semesters for associate's

**Scaffold note:** TAG is New Jersey's largest state grant program and one of the most generous need-based programs nationally. Up to $11K at public research universities and $14K at private schools is substantial. TAG only works at NJ institutions, so the plan should explicitly model NJ schools with TAG + Pell stacked. For families considering out-of-state schools, show them what they'd be leaving on the table.

### VIRGINIA -- VTAG, VGAP, and Commonwealth Award

Virginia has a split system: one program for private school students, two for public.

**Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant (VTAG) -- for private schools**
- Requirements: Virginia domiciliary, enrolled full-time at an eligible private nonprofit Virginia college. NOT need-based: no FAFSA required, no income limit. Must not be in a program of religious training. Apply by September 15.
- Covers: $5,250/year flat grant. Students at Virginia private HBCUs receive an additional $7,500 supplement ($12,750/year total).
- Duration: Up to 8 semesters (4 years)

**Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (VGAP) -- for public schools**
- Requirements: Virginia domiciliary, graduated from a Virginia high school with 2.5+ GPA, dependent student, demonstrated financial need via FAFSA, enrolled full-time at a Virginia public institution.
- Covers: Up to $7,395/year (2025-26), proportional to need
- Duration: Up to 4 years at 4-year institutions

**Virginia Commonwealth Award -- for public schools (catch-all)**
- Requirements: Virginia resident, enrolled at a Virginia public institution, financial need via FAFSA. For students who don't qualify for VGAP (independent students, those without 2.5 HS GPA).
- Covers: Up to $5,250/year

**Scaffold note:** Virginia's key question is public vs. private. Private school students get VTAG ($5,250, no need test) automatically. The HBCU supplement makes VTAG especially valuable at Hampton, Virginia Union, etc. ($12,750/year). Public school students should file FAFSA for VGAP/Commonwealth Award consideration. These don't stack, Virginia uses whichever fits the student's profile.

---

### OREGON -- Oregon Opportunity Grant

- Requirements: Oregon resident 12+ months, undergraduate with no prior bachelor's, enrolled at least half-time (6+ credits) at an Oregon public or private nonprofit institution, SAI of $8,000 or below. File FAFSA or ORSAA (for undocumented students) as early as possible.
- Covers (2025-26, full-time at SAI 0 or below):
  - 4-year institutions: up to $7,800
  - Community college BAS programs: up to $5,964
  - Community colleges: up to $4,272
  - Awards scale down as SAI increases; prorated for part-time
- Renewal: Annual FAFSA/ORSAA, maintain SAP. First-time recipients who file by May 1 may get guaranteed renewal.
- Duration: Up to 4 years (12 quarters or 8 semesters)
- Key details: First-come, first-served. Funds can run out. Early FAFSA is critical.

**Scaffold note:** OOG is substantial at 4-year schools ($7,800 max) but the first-come-first-served model means timing matters more than anything. The plan should tell Oregon families to file FAFSA on the very first day it opens. Works at both public and private Oregon schools. The $8,000 SAI cap reaches well into moderate-income territory.

---

### CONNECTICUT -- Roberta B. Willis Scholarship & CHESLA

**Roberta B. Willis Need-Merit Scholarship**
- Requirements: CT resident, top 20th percentile of graduating class with 1200+ SAT or 25+ ACT, SAI of $10,999 or below. File FAFSA by February 15. Must attend a CT public or private nonprofit 4-year college (excludes Yale and Wesleyan).
- Covers: Up to $5,250/year
- Duration: Up to 6 years

**Roberta B. Willis Need-Based Grant**
- Requirements: CT resident, financial need via FAFSA by February 15. Same institution restrictions.
- Covers: Up to $4,500/year
- Duration: Up to 6 years

**CHESLA Undergraduate Scholarship**
- Requirements: CT resident, 2.5+ GPA, Pell-eligible
- Covers: Up to $3,000/year (full-time)

**Scaffold note:** Connecticut's 4-year aid comes through the Willis program in two flavors: need-merit (up to $5,250 with academic requirements) and need-only (up to $4,500). Both exclude Yale and Wesleyan. A qualifying student could stack Willis need-merit + CHESLA for up to $8,250/year. Emphasize the February 15 FAFSA deadline.

---

### MARYLAND -- Howard P. Rawlings Educational Excellence Awards

**Guaranteed Access (GA) Grant**
- Requirements: Maryland resident, under age 26, enrolled full-time at an eligible MD institution, family income at or below 130% of federal poverty guidelines (roughly $40,600 for a family of four). File FAFSA by March 1.
- Covers: Up to $18,000/year, designed to cover 100% of educational costs for the neediest students
- Duration: Up to 4 years
- Key details: One of the most generous state grants in the country for very low-income students.

**Educational Assistance (EA) Grant**

- Covers: Up to $3,000/year (minimum $400)
- Renewal: Must complete 30 credits/year after second year
- Duration: Up to 4 years

**Scaffold note:** Maryland has a two-tier system: the GA Grant (up to $18K/year for very low-income families, one of the nation's most generous) and the EA Grant (up to $3K for moderate-need students). Both require MD institutions and March 1 FAFSA deadline. For low-income MD families, the GA Grant is transformative. Note the age-26 limit and the 30-credit/year progress requirement for EA renewals.

---

### MISSOURI -- Bright Flight & Access Missouri

**Bright Flight Scholarship (merit-only)**
- Requirements: Missouri resident, ACT composite in top 5% of MO test-takers. Two tiers: Tier 1 (ACT 32+): up to $3,000/year. Tier 2 (ACT 30-31): up to $1,000/year. Must enroll full-time at a MO institution immediately after high school graduation (no gap year). No FAFSA required. No separate application.
- Renewal: 2.5 cumulative GPA
- Duration: Up to 10 semesters

**Access Missouri Grant (need-based)**
- Requirements: Missouri resident, SAI of $12,000 or below, enrolled full-time (12+ credits) at a MO institution. File FAFSA by February 1.
- Covers: Public 2-year: $500-$1,700. Public/private 4-year: $1,750-$3,500.
- Renewal: 2.5 cumulative GPA
- Duration: Up to 10 semesters

**Scaffold note:** A high-scoring Missouri student with financial need could stack Bright Flight ($3,000) + Access Missouri (up to $3,500) for up to $6,500/year in state aid. Bright Flight requires no application but has a strict no-gap-year rule. Access Missouri requires early FAFSA filing (February 1).

---

### SOUTH DAKOTA -- Opportunity Scholarship

- Requirements: South Dakota resident, ACT 24+ (or SAT equivalent). Two tracks:
  - ACT 28+: No curriculum or GPA requirements
  - ACT 24-27: Must complete approved high school curriculum with C or higher in each course
- Covers: Up to $7,500 total over 4 years (roughly $1,875/year). Merit-based, no income test.
- Renewal: 3.0 cumulative GPA, checked each semester. Below 3.0 = forfeited until GPA restored.
- Duration: Up to 4 years. Must enter within 5 years of high school graduation.
- Available at accredited South Dakota institutions (public, private, and technical colleges with SD campus)

**Scaffold note:** SDOS is modest ($7,500 total) but broadly accessible at ACT 24+. The 3.0 college GPA requirement is strictly enforced each semester. South Dakota has limited other state aid, so institutional scholarships from individual SD schools are where the larger dollars come from.

---

### PENNSYLVANIA -- PA State Grant & Grow PA Scholarship

**PA State Grant**
- Need-based grant administered by PHEAA
- Maximum award varies by institution (historically up to roughly $4,500 at state-related universities)
- Must file FAFSA by May 1
- PA resident for 12 consecutive months, pursuing first bachelor's degree
- Available at PA colleges only. Limited to 8 full-time semesters.

**Grow PA Scholarship Grant (NEW, starting 2025-26)**
- Up to $5,000/year for up to 4 years ($20,000 total)
- Must be PA resident, enrolled at least half-time in eligible associate or bachelor's degree at an approved PA institution
- Program must lead to an in-demand occupation (460+ eligible programs across business, STEM, nursing, education, criminal justice, agriculture, and more)
- Work requirement: Must live and work in PA in an in-demand occupation for years equal to years of grant received. If not met, the grant converts to a loan.
- First-come, first-served. Apply as soon as possible; funds run out.
- Renewal applicants get priority
- File FAFSA first, then apply through PHEAA Account Access

**Scaffold note:** Grow PA is meaningful, but the work-commitment requirement makes it a conditional scholarship that converts to a loan if you leave Pennsylvania. The plan should model total cost with PA State Grant + Grow PA + Pell layered together, and be clear about the work obligation. Early FAFSA filing is critical.

## 4. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAMS

Most of these are "last-dollar" scholarships: federal and state aid are applied first, and the program covers remaining tuition. Listed alphabetically by state.

## 5. REGIONAL & UNIQUE PROGRAMS

---

### DC TAG (DC Tuition Assistance Grant)

- DC resident (domiciled) for 12+ months, pursuing first bachelor's or associate's degree
- At public universities nationwide: Up to $15,000/year toward the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition (lifetime max $75,000)
- At private HBCUs nationwide and private nonprofits in DC metro area: Up to $3,750/year (lifetime max $18,750)
- Duration: Up to 6 years from first semester enrolled
- No GPA or test score requirement for initial eligibility
- Must be enrolled at least half-time and maintain satisfactory academic progress
- Note: Income limit is statutory max of $1M but effective threshold for recent cohorts is approximately $624K (adjusted for inflation by entry year)

**Scaffold note:** DC TAG is one of the most unique programs in the country. Because DC has no flagship state university, the program gives DC residents a tuition discount at hundreds of public universities nationwide. For any DC family, the plan should model cost of attendance at target public schools with $15K/year DC TAG applied. This can make out-of-state publics like UVA, Maryland, or Michigan meaningfully more affordable.

---

### Western Undergraduate Exchange (WUE)

- Administered by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE)
- Students from participating western states pay 150% of in-state tuition (instead of full out-of-state rates) at participating institutions in other western states
- Participating states: AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NV, NM, ND, OR, SD, UT, WA, WY, and Pacific territories (American Samoa, CNMI, Guam)
- Over 160 participating institutions
- Savings can be $10,000-$20,000/year compared to full out-of-state tuition
- Some schools and programs are excluded; WUE is competitive at many institutions

**Scaffold note:** WUE can dramatically expand the list of affordable options for families in western states. The plan should flag WUE-eligible schools that are good fits and model the WUE rate vs. in-state at the family's home state flagship.

---

### Academic Common Market (Southern Regional Education Board)

- Students from SREB member states can attend out-of-state institutions at in-state rates IF their desired program is not available in their home state
- Member states: AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, WV
- Must be pursuing a specific program designated as eligible
- Application through home state's SREB coordinator

---

### Midwest Student Exchange Program (MSEP)

- Students from participating midwestern states pay no more than 150% of in-state tuition at participating institutions
- Participating states: IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, NE, ND, OH, WI
- Over 100 participating institutions

---

### New England Regional Student Program (RSP / Tuition Break)

- Students from CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, and VT pay reduced tuition at public institutions in other New England states
- Must pursue a major not available at public institutions in their home state
- Tuition rate: 150% of in-state tuition or less

---

### ALABAMA -- Alabama Student Assistance Program (ASAP)

**Alabama Student Assistance Program (ASAP)**
- Requirements: Need-based grant for Alabama residents. Must be an undergraduate enrolled at least half-time at one of nearly 80 participating Alabama institutions. Must complete the FAFSA and be eligible for the Federal Pell Grant. No merit/GPA requirement.
- Covers: $300 to $5,000 per academic year. Awarded directly by the institution based on available funding and demonstrated financial need.
- Renewal: Must resubmit FAFSA each year. Must maintain satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: Available for duration of undergraduate study, though annual funding is not guaranteed. First-come, first-served.
- Key details: Alabama does not have a statewide merit scholarship program comparable to Georgia HOPE or Florida Bright Futures. The ASAP is entirely need-based and requires Pell eligibility. Individual Alabama universities (University of Alabama, Auburn, UAB) offer their own generous institutional merit scholarships, but those are campus-specific, not state programs.

**Scaffold note:** For Alabama families, emphasize that the state's financial aid landscape is dominated by institutional merit awards rather than a state merit scholarship. For need-based families, flag ASAP as a potential supplement to Pell but caution that amounts are modest and variable. The real financial leverage comes from institutional merit (e.g., UA's automatic merit ladder, Auburn's competitive awards).

---

### ARIZONA -- Arizona Promise Program, AzLEAP

**Arizona Promise Program**
- Requirements: Arizona resident, high school graduate with minimum 2.5 GPA, first-time full-time on-campus degree-seeking student at ASU, NAU, or UA. Must enroll in fall immediately following high school graduation (no gap year). Must complete FAFSA by April 1 and qualify for Federal Pell Grant.
- Covers: All in-state tuition and mandatory program fees after all other scholarships and grants (last-dollar). Does NOT cover housing, meal plans, books, or other non-tuition expenses.
- Renewal: Must remain Pell-eligible, file FAFSA by April 1 annually, enroll full-time (12+ credits) each fall/spring, maintain satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: Up to 4 academic years (8 consecutive fall/spring semesters).
- Key details: Effectively makes Arizona's three public universities tuition-free for Pell-eligible students. Only applies to on-campus enrollment (not online-only). The 2.5 GPA floor is relatively low. Room and board are not covered and can still be significant.

**AzLEAP (Arizona Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership)**
- Requirements: Arizona resident, enrolled at least half-time, Pell-eligible, must complete FAFSA.
- Covers: Up to $2,500/year; average awards approximately $1,000.
- Key details: Modest supplemental need-based grant. Funding is limited and varies by institution.

**Scaffold note:** For Arizona families with Pell-eligible students, Arizona Promise should be a centerpiece of the financial strategy. Flag the April 1 FAFSA deadline and the no-gap-year requirement. Quantify the remaining room/board gap. AzLEAP is a small bonus, not a primary funding source.

---

### COLORADO -- Colorado Promise (Tax Credit), Colorado Student Grant

**Colorado Promise (Refundable Tax Credit)**
- Requirements: Colorado resident, family AGI of $90,000 or less, completed high school after January 1, 2024, enrolled at a Colorado public institution within 2 years of graduation. Must complete at least 6 credits/semester with 2.5 GPA. Must complete FAFSA or CASFA annually.
- Covers: Full reimbursement of tuition and fees paid out-of-pocket (after scholarships/grants) via a refundable state income tax credit. Covers up to 65 credits. Does not cover room, board, or books.
- Duration: Up to 65 credits (approximately 2 years of full-time enrollment).
- Key details: This is a tax credit, not a traditional grant. Students pay upfront, then claim reimbursement on their Colorado tax return. Creates a timing gap of several months. The 65-credit cap makes this effectively a "two free years" program.

**Colorado Student Grant**
- Requirements: Colorado resident, demonstrated financial need via FAFSA, enrolled in at least 6 credits at an eligible Colorado institution.
- Covers: Up to $5,000/year, dependent on enrollment and funding.
- Key details: Need-based, varies by institution and year based on state appropriations.

**Scaffold note:** For Colorado families under $90K, the Promise tax credit can make the first two years of public college tuition-free, but the plan MUST flag the tax-credit structure: families need cash to cover costs upfront and will be reimbursed months later. The 65-credit cap means families should plan for the benefit ending around junior year. Pairs well with a community-college-first 2+2 pathway.

---

### IOWA -- Iowa Tuition Grant, Future Ready Iowa Last-Dollar Scholarship

**Iowa Tuition Grant**
- Requirements: Iowa resident enrolled at a participating private nonprofit Iowa college. Must complete FAFSA by July 1. SAI between -1,500 and 16,000 for 2025-26.
- Covers: Up to $7,500/year. Many participating colleges match dollar-for-dollar, effectively doubling to $15,000 in combined support.
- Renewal: Annual FAFSA by July 1, maintain satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: Up to 4 years (8 semesters).
- Key details: One of the most generous state grants for private college students in the country. The institutional matching provision is a major hidden benefit. The SAI cap of 16,000 is relatively generous, making many middle-income families eligible.

**Future Ready Iowa Last-Dollar Scholarship**
- Requirements: Iowa resident, SAI at or below 20,000. Must complete FAFSA by December 31. Must be seeking a certification or associate degree in a high-demand occupation at an Iowa community college.
- Covers: Last-dollar coverage of tuition and fees after all other grants/scholarships. Max $225/credit hour.
- Key details: Specifically for workforce-oriented credentials at community colleges in high-demand fields (healthcare, IT, manufacturing). December 31 FAFSA deadline is critical and unusual.

**Scaffold note:** For Iowa families considering private colleges, the Iowa Tuition Grant should reshape the cost comparison. A $7,500 state grant plus an institutional match can make Iowa private colleges surprisingly affordable vs. out-of-state publics. Model this explicitly. Flag the July 1 (Tuition Grant) and December 31 (Future Ready) FAFSA deadlines.

---

### MASSACHUSETTS -- MASSGrant, MASSGrant Plus, MassTransfer

**MASSGrant**
- Requirements: MA resident 12+ months, undergraduate, must complete FAFSA, full-time (12+ credits) at 4-year institutions or part-time (6+ credits) at community colleges.
- Covers: $500 to $2,800/year depending on SAI bracket and institution type.
- Key details: Modest need-based award, best understood as a supplement to Pell.

**MASSGrant Plus**
- Requirements: Same as MASSGrant but must be Pell-eligible. Family income approximately $85,000 or less.
- Covers: Full cost of tuition and mandatory fees at MA public colleges/universities, plus up to $1,000/year for books. Last-dollar grant.
- Key details: Effectively makes MA public higher education tuition-free for Pell-eligible students. More impactful than MASSGrant.

**MassTransfer Pathway**
- Requirements: Begin at a MA community college, transfer to a MA state university or UMass campus. Must complete a MassTransfer-approved associate degree with 3.0+ GPA.
- Covers: 100% tuition waiver at the receiving 4-year institution for up to 2 years. Commonwealth Commitment add-on: tuition/fee freeze + 10% rebate each semester with full-time enrollment and 3.0+ GPA.
- Key details: One of the best-designed 2+2 transfer systems in the country. Guaranteed credit transfer via A2B pathway maps prevents credit loss.

**Scaffold note:** For Pell-eligible families, MASSGrant Plus is the headline — it makes public higher education essentially free. For cost-conscious families, MassTransfer is a powerful 2+2 strategy: free community college tuition via MASSGrant Plus, then tuition waiver + 10% rebate at a state university. Model this pathway explicitly.

---

### MONTANA -- MUS Honor Scholarship, 2+2 Honor Scholarship

**MUS Honor Scholarship**
- Requirements: Montana high school senior (enrolled full-time 3+ years including senior year), 3.4+ GPA at end of 7th semester, must complete Board of Regents Rigorous Core curriculum (4 years math/English/science, 3 years social studies, 3 years college-prep electives) OR hold an IB Diploma. Must take ACT or SAT by February of senior year.
- Covers: Tuition waiver at eligible MUS campuses. Approximately $5,000/year (~$20,000 over 4 years). Does NOT cover mandatory fees.
- Renewal: 3.4 cumulative GPA, 30 credits after 2 semesters, 60 after 4, 90 after 6.
- Duration: Up to 4 years (8 semesters). Application: December 1 to March 15.
- Key details: Competitive — up to 200 awards annually. The Rigorous Core is more demanding than standard minimum requirements, so students must plan early.

**2+2 Honor Scholarship**
- Requirements: Associate degree from eligible 2-year MUS campus or MT community college, 3.4+ GPA, Montana resident. Must begin using scholarship the semester immediately after receiving the associate degree (no gap).
- Covers: Tuition waiver at eligible 4-year MUS campuses for up to 2 years.
- Key details: Creates a strong 2+2 pathway. Application deadline is June 30 after receiving associate degree. No deferral option.

**Scaffold note:** For Montana families, position the MUS Honor Scholarship as the state's premier merit award, but note it's competitive (limited to ~200 awards) and requires the Rigorous Core curriculum. Verify early whether the student's high school schedule aligns. For 2+2 students, the combination of low community college costs + 2+2 Honor Scholarship tuition waiver is a strong strategy.

### NEBRASKA -- Nebraska Opportunity Grant (NOG)

**Nebraska Opportunity Grant (NOG)**
- Requirements: Nebraska resident, Pell-eligible, enrolled full-time (12+ credits), must complete FAFSA. Must not have earned a bachelor's degree.
- Covers: Statutory max approximately $5,700/year, but actual awards typically $1,000 to $2,500 depending on institution and funding. The state allocates funding to institutions by formula, and each institution distributes to eligible students.
- Renewal: Annual FAFSA, maintain Pell eligibility and satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: Duration of undergraduate study, subject to annual funding.
- Key details: First-come, first-served — early FAFSA filing is critical. The same student may receive different NOG amounts at different Nebraska institutions. Nebraska has no statewide merit scholarship program.

**Scaffold note:** For Nebraska families with financial need, note NOG as a supplement to Pell with realistic expectations about the likely amount. Emphasize early FAFSA filing. Institutional merit awards from individual campuses (UNL, UNO, Creighton) are where the larger scholarship dollars come from.

### NEVADA -- Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship & Nevada Promise Scholarship

**Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship (merit-based)**
- Requirements: 3.25 weighted GPA from a Nevada high school (or GED equivalent), Nevada resident
- Covers: Up to $10,000 lifetime (roughly $80/credit at community colleges, $40/credit at universities)
- Must attend a Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) institution
- Duration: Available for up to 6 years after high school graduation

**Nevada Promise Scholarship (community college)**
- Requirements: Recent Nevada high school graduate under age 20, must complete 20 hours of community service per year, file FAFSA, participate in mentoring
- Covers: Last-dollar tuition coverage at NSHE community colleges for up to 3 years
- Key details: Covers gap between other aid and tuition at 2-year schools only. Must enroll in fall immediately following high school graduation.

**Scaffold note:** Nevada families have two distinct state programs that serve different purposes. The Millennium Scholarship is merit-based (3.25 GPA) and works at both 2-year and 4-year NSHE schools, but its $10,000 lifetime cap makes it a supplement, not a full ride. The Promise Scholarship can make community college tuition-free for recent graduates. A student who qualifies for both could stack Millennium + Promise for community college, then use remaining Millennium dollars at a 4-year NSHE campus. The plan should model this layered approach.

### NEW HAMPSHIRE -- CCSNH Promise Program, Granite Guarantee

**CCSNH Promise Program**
- Requirements: NH resident, Pell-eligible, enrolled in at least 6 credits at one of NH's seven community colleges. Must complete FAFSA.
- Covers: Last-dollar coverage of remaining tuition and fees after all other grants/scholarships. Effectively makes community college tuition-free for Pell-eligible students.
- Key details: No separate application required — automatically considered when FAFSA is filed. Launched 2023-24.

**Granite Guarantee (University System of NH)**
- Requirements: NH resident, Pell-eligible, first-time student or CCSNH graduate. Must enroll full-time at UNH, Plymouth State, Keene State, or Granite State College.
- Covers: Full tuition waiver for fall/spring semesters. Does NOT cover fees, room, board, or other expenses.
- Duration: Up to 4 years (8 semesters) for first-time students; up to 2 years for CCSNH transfers.
- Key details: At UNH, mandatory fees can exceed tuition, so "tuition-free" does not mean "free." Room and board are additional.

**Scaffold note:** For Pell-eligible NH families, the Promise + Granite Guarantee combination creates a powerful 2+2 pathway: free community college via Promise, then free tuition at a state university via Granite Guarantee. But critically flag that Granite Guarantee covers tuition only — not fees. At UNH, remaining costs can still be significant. NH offers limited state aid for non-Pell families.

### NORTH DAKOTA -- North Dakota Scholarship

**North Dakota Scholarship (Class of 2025+, replaces ND Academic and CTE Scholarships)**
- Requirements: Must fulfill all "Essential Skills" requirements AND meet at least 2 of 3 pathway components: Post-Secondary Ready (ACT 24+), Workforce Ready (4 CTE credits + ACT 24 or WorkKeys 5s + 2 additional indicators), or Military Ready. Must maintain 2.75 cumulative GPA in college.
- Covers: $750/semester ($1,500/year). Total maximum $6,000.
- Renewal: GPA monitored each term. One warning for GPA below 2.75; second failure permanently suspends eligibility.
- Duration: 6 years following high school graduation to use full $6,000.
- Key details: Modest award. The Essential Skills + pathway structure is more complex than a simple GPA/test cutoff, so students must plan high school curriculum carefully. Students who earned the old Academic/CTE Scholarship before 2025 continue under prior rules.

**Scaffold note:** For North Dakota families, note the ND Scholarship as helpful but modest ($1,500/year). Flag the curriculum planning needed to meet Essential Skills + pathway requirements. ND public university tuition is already among the lowest in the nation, so even without large state scholarships, in-state options are affordable.

### OHIO -- Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG), Buckeye Bridge Initiative

**Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG)**
- Requirements: Ohio resident, SAI of 3,750 or less, household income $96,000 or less, enrolled in associate or bachelor's program at eligible Ohio institution (public or private nonprofit). Must complete FAFSA by October 1 (unusually early deadline).
- Covers: Up to $5,000/year ($2,500/semester) for full-time enrollment in 2025-26.
- Renewal: FAFSA by October 1 each year, maintain SAI/income thresholds, satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: 10 semesters or 15 quarters (5 years).
- Key details: The October 1 FAFSA deadline is critical — missing it forfeits OCOG for the entire year. Available at both public and private nonprofit Ohio institutions.

**Buckeye Bridge Initiative (Ohio State + Columbus State)**
- Requirements: Graduate from Columbus State Community College with an associate degree. Family AGI $100,000 or less. Must file FAFSA by February 1. Must transfer to Ohio State within 3 semesters of graduating Columbus State.
- Covers: Full waiver of Ohio State tuition and mandatory fees. Does not cover room, board, or books.
- Duration: Up to 8 semesters at Ohio State.
- Key details: Launches Spring 2026. Partnership between two specific institutions only, not statewide. The $100,000 threshold is generous.

**Scaffold note:** For Ohio families, the plan MUST emphasize the October 1 FAFSA deadline for OCOG — one of the earliest in the country. For Columbus-area families under $100K, Buckeye Bridge (Columbus State to Ohio State, tuition-free) should be highlighted as a potentially transformative option. Note it's brand new (2026) and the 3-semester transfer window is tight.

### UTAH -- Utah Promise, Utah Opportunity Scholarship

**Utah Promise Scholarship (Institutional Programs)**
- Requirements: Vary by USHE campus. At University of Utah (launching Fall 2026): first-time first-year, graduated HS 2026+, family income and assets each under $100,000, apply by December 1, FAFSA by February 1.
- Covers: Full tuition and mandatory fees (last-dollar). Does not typically cover room, board, or books.
- Renewal: At U of U: 3.5 cumulative GPA, full-time enrollment. Other campuses: satisfactory academic progress, FAFSA annually, typically 24 credits/year.
- Duration: Up to 4 years.
- Key details: Not a single statewide program — each USHE campus has its own version with different thresholds. The U of U's 3.5 GPA renewal requirement is notably high and could cause students to lose the scholarship.

**Utah Opportunity Scholarship (Statewide Merit, replaced Regents' Scholarship)**
- Requirements: Utah HS graduate, 3.3+ GPA, at least 1 AP/IB/CE course in each of Math, Science, and Language Arts (3 total). Must complete FAFSA.
- Covers: Up to $1,000/semester for up to 4 semesters. Maximum $4,000 total.
- Duration: 2 years (4 semesters).
- Key details: Modest but meaningful given Utah's low public tuition. Students must plan HS course selections to include qualifying AP/IB/CE courses. Application for Class of 2026: January 5 to March 20.

**Scaffold note:** For need-based Utah families, identify which USHE campus's promise program has the best terms. Flag U of U's 3.5 GPA renewal risk. The Opportunity Scholarship is a helpful supplement but at $4,000 total, not a primary funding source. Utah's in-state tuition is already quite low, making any state aid more impactful percentage-wise.

### WISCONSIN -- Wisconsin Grant

**Wisconsin Grant**
- Requirements: Wisconsin resident, undergraduate, must complete FAFSA, demonstrate financial need. Four sub-programs: WG-UW (UW System), WG-WTC (Technical Colleges), WG-TR (Tribal), WG-PNP (Private Nonprofits).
- Covers: $875 to $3,500/year for full-time enrollment in 2025-26. Prorated for part-time: 9-11 credits = 75%, 6-8 credits = 50%, 1-5 credits = 25%. WG-PNP: approximately $250 to $3,150.
- Renewal: Annual FAFSA, continued financial need, satisfactory academic progress.
- Duration: Maximum 10 semesters across all four sub-programs.
- Key details: Four separate programs unified under one name, each with its own funding pool and award formulas set annually by HEAB. Wisconsin has no statewide merit scholarship program.

**Scaffold note:** For Wisconsin families, note the Wisconsin Grant as a need-based supplement to Pell ($875-$3,500). Flag that Wisconsin offers no statewide merit scholarship, so institutional merit awards from individual campuses (UW-Madison, Marquette, etc.) are where the larger scholarship dollars come from. The 10-semester cap means students who take longer than 5 years lose state grant eligibility.

## NOTES FOR THE SCAFFOLD PROMPT

These rules apply across all plans, regardless of the family's state.

1. **Always identify the family's state-specific programs by name.** The plan should never say "look into your state's programs." It should name the program, state the requirements, and tell the family whether their kid is on track to qualify.

2. **Frame merit thresholds as concrete goals.** "Protect the 3.7 GPA" (Georgia). "Get to 1200 SAT" (Georgia). "Hit ACT 27 for TOPS Honors" (Louisiana). These are actionable targets that belong in the developmental roadmap.

3. **Flag early-action deadlines explicitly.** Indiana 21st Century Scholars (must enroll by 8th grade), Oklahoma's Promise (apply by 8th-12th grade, earlier is better), and FAFSA deadlines that vary by state (Ohio: October 1, Illinois MAP: as early as possible, Iowa Future Ready: December 31). If the student is young enough to act on these, they belong in the "do this now" section of the plan.

4. **Model state aid as a layer, not a standalone number.** Show families the full stack: Pell + state grant + institutional merit + federal loans = net cost. Never present a state program in isolation. A $4,500 Tennessee HOPE on top of a $7,395 Pell on top of a $10,000 institutional merit award tells a very different story than HOPE alone.

5. **Distinguish between guaranteed and competitive programs.** Georgia HOPE/Zell Miller, Florida Bright Futures, and Kentucky KEES are entitlement programs: meet the criteria, get the money. Montana MUS Honor (200 awards), Alabama ASAP (first-come-first-served), and Colorado Student Grant (limited pool) are competitive or rationed. The plan should be clear about which category each program falls into so families know what they can count on vs. what they should hope for.

6. **Flag residency requirements and post-graduation obligations.** New York Excelsior converts to a loan if you leave NY. Pennsylvania Grow PA converts to a loan if you leave PA. Kansas Promise requires 2 years of living/working in Kansas. Rhode Island Promise requires living/working in RI. These are real financial commitments that constrain a student's post-graduation options. The plan should present them as trade-offs, not free money.

7. **Handle public vs. private school strategy per state.** In Iowa, the Tuition Grant + institutional match can make private colleges cheaper than out-of-state publics. In Georgia, Zell Miller makes public colleges nearly free but provides nothing at private schools. In California, Cal Grant A covers UC tuition but the Middle Class Scholarship extends to families earning up to $234K. The plan should know which states reward staying public, which reward going private, and where the math is close enough to warrant modeling both.

8. **Check regional exchange eligibility.** If the family is in a WUE state (western), MSEP state (midwest), SREB state (southern), or New England RSP state, flag relevant exchange programs when suggesting out-of-state public schools. A Montana student considering University of Oregon should know about WUE (150% of in-state). A Kentucky student interested in a program not offered in-state should know about the Academic Common Market.

9. **Account for DC's unique situation.** DC has no state university. DC TAG ($15K/year at public universities nationwide) fundamentally changes the math for DC families. Any plan for a DC family should model target public universities with DC TAG applied. Do not assume DC students pay full out-of-state tuition.

10. **Never fabricate state program names or details.** If you are unsure whether a state has a specific program, do not invent one. It is better to say "check with [state]'s higher education agency for current state aid programs" than to cite a program that doesn't exist or has been discontinued. Families will try to find these programs and will lose trust if the names are wrong.

11. **Note when programs are new or recently changed.** Louisiana TOPS Excellence (added 2025), Pennsylvania Grow PA (started 2025-26), Ohio Buckeye Bridge (launching 2026), North Dakota Scholarship (replaced Academic/CTE for Class of 2025+). New programs may have limited public awareness, so families may not have heard of them. Flag newness as a reason to verify details directly with the school or state agency.

12. **Prioritize the highest-impact programs for each family.** Not every state program is worth mentioning. For a Georgia family earning $60K, Zell Miller is the entire financial strategy and deserves a full paragraph. The FAFSA state deadline deserves a sentence. A $500 supplemental grant can be mentioned in passing or skipped. Match the depth of coverage to the financial impact for that specific family.

13. **Check gap year compatibility.** Multiple state programs require enrollment immediately after high school graduation: Missouri Bright Flight, Arizona Promise, Tennessee Promise, Florida Bright Futures (August 31 deadline). If a family is considering a gap year, explicitly check whether each identified state program allows deferred enrollment and for how long. Flag any programs that would be forfeited.

14. **Handle military families carefully.** Military families move frequently. Check whether the student's state of legal residence or the state where they attend high school determines eligibility. Many states have special military dependent provisions (e.g., Florida Bright Futures, Georgia HOPE).

15. **Address divorced/separated parent situations.** When parents live in different states, state aid eligibility typically follows the custodial parent's state (matching FAFSA). Note that the non-custodial parent's state programs are generally NOT available to the student.

16. **Flag last-dollar program dynamics.** When a state program is last-dollar (Minnesota North Star Promise, Arizona Promise, New Hampshire Granite Guarantee, etc.), winning additional outside scholarships does NOT reduce the family's out-of-pocket cost -- it reduces the state award instead. Explain this clearly so families understand that "more scholarships" does not always mean "less cost" with last-dollar programs.

17. **Warn about dual enrollment credit-hour caps.** If the student has or plans to earn dual enrollment credits, check whether those credits count against the state scholarship's credit-hour cap. Georgia HOPE/Zell Miller's 127-hour cap is the most common example -- dual enrollment hours earned in high school count against it, potentially shortening the scholarship duration in college.
